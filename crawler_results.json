They come as senior intelligence officials testify to the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday, releasing classified documents in response to the Guardian's earlier stories on bulk collection of phone records and Fisa surveillance court oversight. [1]\nThe files shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by the Guardian on June 10. [2]\n\"I, sitting at my desk,\" said Snowden, could \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email\".\nUS officials vehemently denied this specific claim. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee, said of Snowden's assertion: \"He's lying. It's impossible for him to do what he was saying he could do.\"\nBut training materials for XKeyscore detail how analysts can use it and other systems to mine enormous agency databases by filling in a simple on-screen form giving only a broad justification for the search. The request is not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel before it is processed.\nXKeyscore, the documents boast, is the NSA's \"widest reaching\" system developing intelligence from computer networks -- what the agency calls Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). One presentation claims the program covers \"nearly everything a typical user does on the internet\", including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata.\nAnalysts can also use XKeyscore and other NSA systems to obtain ongoing \"real-time\" interception of an individual's internet activity.\nUnder US law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant only if the target of their surveillance is a 'US person', though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. But XKeyscore provides the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst.\nOne training slide illustrates the digital activity constantly being collected by XKeyscore and the analyst's ability to query the databases at any time.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"347\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS1-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nThe purpose of XKeyscore is to allow analysts to search the metadata as well as the content of emails and other internet activity, such as browser history, even when there is no known email account (a \"selector\" in NSA parlance) associated with the individual being targeted.\nAnalysts can also search by name, telephone number, IP address, keywords, the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used.\nOne document notes that this is because \"strong selection [search by email address] itself gives us only a very limited capability\" because \"a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous.\"\nThe NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore.\nAnalysts are warned that searching the full database for content will yield too many results to sift through. Instead they are advised to use the metadata also stored in the databases to narrow down what to review.\nA slide entitled \"plug-ins\" in a December 2012 document describes the various fields of information that can be searched. It includes \"every email address seen in a session by both username and domain\", \"every phone number seen in a session (eg address book entries or signature block)\" and user activity -- \"the webmail and chat activity to include username, buddylist, machine specific cookies etc\".\n<strong>Email monitoring</strong><br/>\nIn a second Guardian interview in June, Snowden elaborated on his statement about being able to read any individual's email if he had their email address. He said the claim was based in part on the email search capabilities of XKeyscore, which Snowden says he was authorized to use while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA.\nOne top-secret document describes how the program \"searches within bodies of emails, webpages and documents\", including the \"To, From, CC, BCC lines\" and the 'Contact Us' pages on websites\".\nTo search for emails, an analyst using XKS enters the individual's email address into a simple online search form, along with the \"justification\" for the search and the time period for which the emails are sought.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS2-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS3edit2-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nThe analyst then selects which of those returned emails they want to read by opening them in NSA reading software.\nThe system is similar to the way in which NSA analysts generally can intercept the communications of anyone they select, including, as one NSA document put it, \"communications that transit the United States and communications that terminate in the United States\".\nOne document, a top secret 2010 guide describing the training received by NSA analysts for general surveillance under the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008, explains that analysts can begin surveillance on anyone by clicking a few simple pull-down menus designed to provide both legal and targeting justifications. Once options on the pull-down menus are selected, their target is marked for electronic surveillance and the analyst is able to review the content of their communications:\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"353\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS4-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<strong>Chats, browsing history and other internet activity</strong><br/>\nBeyond emails, the XKeyscore system allows analysts to monitor a virtually unlimited array of other internet activities, including those within social media.\nAn NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"333\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS55edit-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nAn analyst can monitor such Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS6-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>Analysts can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"329\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS7-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>As one slide indicates, the ability to search HTTP activity by keyword permits the analyst access to what the NSA calls \"nearly everything a typical user does on the internet\".<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"324\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS8-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>The XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"258\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS9-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>The quantity of communications accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is staggeringly large. One NSA report from 2007 estimated that there were 850bn \"call events\" collected and stored in the NSA databases, and close to 150bn internet records. Each day, the document says, 1-2bn records were added.\nWilliam Binney, a former NSA mathematician, said last year that the agency had \"assembled on the order of 20tn transactions about US citizens with other US citizens\", an estimate, he said, that \"only was involving phone calls and emails\". A 2010 Washington Post article reported that \"every day, collection systems at the [NSA] intercept and store 1.7bn emails, phone calls and other type of communications.\"\nThe XKeyscore system is continuously collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content remains on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains: \"At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.\"\nTo solve this problem, the NSA has created a multi-tiered system that allows analysts to store \"interesting\" content in other databases, such as one named Pinwale which can store material for up to five years. \nIt is the databases of XKeyscore, one document shows, that now contain the greatest amount of communications data collected by the NSA.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"325\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS10-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nIn 2012, there were at least 41 billion total records collected and stored in XKeyscore for a single 30-day period.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"187\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS11-002.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"220\"/><br/>\n<br/><strong>Legal v technical restrictions</strong><br/>\nWhile the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of US persons, NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA's foreign targets.\nThe ACLU's deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, told the Guardian last month that national security officials expressly said that a primary purpose of the new law was to enable them to collect large amounts of Americans' communications without individualized warrants.\n\"The government doesn't need to 'target' Americans in order to collect huge volumes of their communications,\" said Jaffer. \"The government inevitably sweeps up the communications of many Americans\" when targeting foreign nationals for surveillance.\nAn example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and New York.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"257\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS12-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nIn recent years, the NSA has attempted to segregate exclusively domestic US communications in separate databases. But even NSA documents acknowledge that such efforts are imperfect, as even purely domestic communications can travel on foreign systems, and NSA tools are sometimes unable to identify the national origins of communications.\nMoreover, all communications between Americans and someone on foreign soil are included in the same databases as foreign-to-foreign communications, making them readily searchable without warrants.\nSome searches conducted by NSA analysts are periodically reviewed by their supervisors within the NSA. \"It's very rare to be questioned on our searches,\" Snowden told the Guardian in June, \"and even when we are, it's usually along the lines of: 'let's bulk up the justification'.\"\nIn a letter this week to senator Ron Wyden, director of national intelligence James Clapper acknowledged that NSA analysts have exceeded even legal limits as interpreted by the NSA in domestic surveillance.\nAcknowledging what he called \"a number of compliance problems\", Clapper attributed them to \"human error\" or \"highly sophisticated technology issues\" rather than \"bad faith\".\nHowever, Wyden said on the Senate floor on Tuesday: \"These violations are more serious than those stated by the intelligence community, and are troubling.\"\nIn a statement to the Guardian, the NSA said: \"NSA's activities are focused and specifically deployed against -- and only against -- legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests.\n\"XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system.\n\"Allegations of widespread, unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks ... In addition, there are multiple technical, manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring.\"\n\"Every search by an NSA analyst is fully auditable, to ensure that they are proper and within the law.\n\"These types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully -- to defend the nation and to protect US and allied troops abroad.\"\n[1] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files</a><br/>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video\" title=\"\">http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video</a>\n</div>",

Appelbaum, A. Gibson, J. Goetz, V. Kabisch, L. Kampf, L. Ryge\nThe investigation discloses the following:\n* Two servers in Germany - in Berlin and Nuremberg - are under surveillance by the NSA.\n* Merely searching the web for the privacy-enhancing software tools outlined in the XKeyscore rules causes the NSA to mark and track the IP address of the person doing the search. Not only are German privacy software users tracked, but the source code shows that privacy software users worldwide are tracked by the NSA.\n* Among the NSA's targets is the Tor network funded primarily by the US government to aid democracy advocates in authoritarian states.\n* The XKeyscore rules reveal that the NSA tracks all connections to a server that hosts part of an anonymous email service at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It also records details about visits to a popular internet journal for Linux operating system users called \"the Linux Journal - the Original Magazine of the Linux Community\", and calls it an \"extremist forum\".\n\n<blockquote><strong>Disclosure</strong>\nThree authors of this investigation have personal and professional ties to the Tor Project, an American company mentioned within the following investigation. Jacob Appelbaum is a paid employee of the Tor Project, Aaron Gibson is a paid contractor for the Tor Project, and Leif Ryge is a volunteer contributor to various Tor-related software projects. Their research in this story is wholly independent from the Tor Project and does not reflect the views of the Tor Project in any way. During the course of the investigation, it was further discovered that an additional computer system run by Jacob Appelbaum for his volunteer work with helping to run part of the Tor network was targeted by the NSA. Moreover, all members of this team are Tor users and appear to be have been targets of the mass surveillance described in the investigation.</blockquote>\n\nIt is a small server that looks like any of the other dozens in the same row. It is in a large room devoted to computers and computer storage, just like every other room in this industrial park building on Am Tower Street just outside the city of Nuremberg. That the grey building is surrounded by barbed wire seems to indicate that the servers' provider is working hard to secure their customers' data.\nYet despite these efforts, one of the servers is targeted by the NSA.\nThe IP address 212.212.245.170 is explicitly specified in the rules of the powerful and invasive spy software program XKeyscore. The code is published here exclusively for the first time.\nAfter a year of NSA revelations based on documents that focus on program names and high-level Powerpoint presentations, NDR and WDR are revealing NSA source code that shows how these programs function and how they are implemented in Germany and around the world.\nMonths of investigation by the German public television broadcasters NDR and WDR, drawing on exclusive access to top secret NSA source code, interviews with former NSA employees, and the review of secret documents of the German government reveal that not only is the server in Nuremberg under observation by the NSA, but so is virtually anyone who has taken an interest in several well-known privacy software systems.\nThe NSA program XKeyscore is a collection and analysis tool and \"a computer network exploitation system\", as described in an NSA presentation. It is one of the agency's most ambitious programs devoted to gathering \"nearly everything a user does on the internet.\" The source code contains several rules that enable agents using XKeyscore to surveil privacy-conscious internet users around the world. The rules published here are specifically directed at the infrastructure and the users of the Tor Network, the Tails operating system, and other privacy-related software.\nTor, also known as The Onion Router, is a network of several thousand volunteer-operated servers, or nodes, that work in concert to conceal Tor users' IP addresses and thus keep them anonymous while online.\nTails is a privacy-focused GNU/Linux-based operating system that runs entirely from an external storage device such as a USB stick or CD. It comes with Tor and other privacy tools pre-installed and configured, and each time it reboots it automatically wipes everything that is not saved on an encrypted persistent storage medium.\nNormally a user's online traffic - such as emails, instant messages, searches, or visits to websites - can be attributed to the IP address assigned to them by their internet service provider. When a user goes online over the Tor Network, their connections are relayed through a number of Tor nodes using another layer of encryption between each server such that the first server cannot see where the last server is located and vice-versa.\nTor is used by private individuals who want to conceal their online activity, human rights activists in oppressive regimes such as China and Iran, journalists who want to protect their sources, and even by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in their efforts to infiltrate criminal groups without revealing their identity. The Tor Project is a non-profit charity based in Massachusetts and is primarily funded by government agencies. Thus it is ironic that the Tor Network has become such a high-priority target in the NSA's worldwide surveillance system.\nAs revealed by the British newspaper The Guardian, there have been repeated efforts to crack the Tor Network and de-anonymize its users. The top secret presentations published in October last year show that Tor is anathema to the NSA. In one presentation, agents refer to the network as \"the king of high-secure, low-latency internet anonymity\". Another is titled \"Tor Stinks\". Despite the snide remarks, the agents admit, \"We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time\".\nThe former NSA director General Keith Alexander stated that all those communicating with encryption will be regarded as terror suspects and will be monitored and stored as a method of prevention, as quoted by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in August last year. The top secret source code published here indicates that the NSA is making a concerted effort to combat any and all anonymous spaces that remain on the internet. Merely visiting privacy-related websites is enough for a user's IP address to be logged into an NSA database.\nAn examination of the XKeyscore rules published here goes beyond the slide presentation and provides a window into the actual instructions given to NSA computers. The code was deployed recently and former NSA employees and experts are convinced that the same code or similar code is still in use today. The XKeyscore rules include elements known as \"appids\", \"fingerprints\", and \"microplugins\". Each connection a user makes online - to a search engine, for example - can be assigned a single appid and any number of fingerprints.\nAppids are unique identifiers for a connection in XKeyscore. Appid rules have weights assigned to them.  When multiple appids match a given connection, the one with the highest weight is chosen. Microplugins may contain software written in general-purpose programming languages, such as C++, which can extract and store specific types of data. The rules specifically target the Tor Project's email and web infrastructure, as well as servers operated by key volunteers in Germany, the United States, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands. Beyond being ethically questionable, the attacks on Tor also raise legal concerns.  The IP addresses of Tor servers in the United States are amongst the targets, which could violate the fourth amendment of the US constitution.\nThe German attorney Thomas Stadler, who specializes in IT law, commented: \"The fact that a German citizen is specifically traced by the NSA, in my opinion, justifies the reasonable suspicion of the NSA carrying out secret service activities in Germany. For this reason, the German Federal Public Prosecutor should look into this matter and initiate preliminary proceedings.\"\nOne of NSA's German targets is 212.212.245.170.  The string of numbers is an IP address assigned to Sebastian Hahn, a computer science student at the University of Erlangen. Hahn operates the server out of a grey high-security building a few kilometers from where he lives. Hahn, 28 years old and sporting a red beard, volunteers for the Tor Project in his free time. He is especially trusted by the Tor community, as his server is not just a node, it is a so-called Directory Authority. There are nine of these worldwide, and they are central to the Tor Network, as they contain an index of all Tor nodes. A user's traffic is automatically directed to one of the directory authorities to download the newest list of Tor relays generated each hour.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode102_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>\"anonymizer/tor/node/authority\" fingerprint.</em>\nHahn's predecessor named the server Gabelmoo, or Fork Man, the nickname of a local statue of Poseidon. After a look at the NSA source code, Hahn quickly found his server's name listed in the XKeyscore rules. \"Yes, I recognize the IP address of my Tor server called 'gabelmoo'.\" he said. \"Millions of people use it to stay safe online, and by watching the server and collecting metadata about its users, those people are put at risk.\" The rule shown to Hahn, published below, has a fingerprint called 'anonymizer/tor/node/authority'. The fingerprint targets users who connect to Gabelmoo and other Tor Directory Authority servers. In Germany, the Tor Directory Authorities like Gabelmoo that are specifically targeted by XKeyscore rules are in Berlin and Nuremberg. Additional targets are located in Austria, Sweden, the United States, and the Netherlands.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode110_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>Fragments of XKeyscore rules targetting Tor directory authorities.</em>\nThe expression below performs essentially the same function, but it specifies the Tor directory authorities located in Five Eyes countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States) separately from those in other countries. As the comment explains, the \"goal is to find potential Tor clients connecting to the Tor directory servers.\"\nAnother rule catalogs users connecting to known Tor relays. This is not difficult, because the addresses of all normal Tor relays are published by the directory authorities so that the Tor software on users' computers can select its own path through the network. In addition to the public relays, connections characterized as Tor based on protocol identifiers are also cataloged.\n<strong>Not only Metadata</strong>\nInternet service providers in countries with strong censorship such as China and Iran frequently block connections to known Tor relays. To avoid this blocking, The Tor Project maintains a list of non-public relays called \"bridges\" to allow users to avoid this type of blocking. Bridges are run by volunteers and they share the details with the Tor Project to help censored users reach the internet.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode108_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>Microplugin which extracts bridge addresses from the full text of Tor Project emails.</em>\nUsers can request a bridge address via email or on the web. The following fingerprints show two ways that XKeyscore attempts to track Tor bridge users. First, the fingerprint \"anonymizer/tor/bridge/tls\" records connections to the bridges.torproject.org server. Second, in order obtain the actual bridge addresses for the purpose of tracking connections to them in the future, the \"microplugin\" fingerprint called \"anonymizer/tor/bridge/email\" extracts data from the body of the emails that the Tor Project sends to its users.\nThis code demonstrates the ease with which an XKeyscore rule can analyze the full content of intercepted connections. The fingerprint first checks every message using the \"email_address\" function to see if the message is to or from \"bridges@torproject.org\". Next, if the address matched, it uses the \"email_body\" function to search the full content of the email for a particular piece of text - in this case, \"https://bridges.torproject.org/\". If the \"email_body\" function finds what it is looking for, it passes the full email text to a C++ program which extracts the bridge addresses and stores them in a database.\nThe full content of the email must already be intercepted before this code can analyze it. XKeyscore also keeps track of people who are not using Tor, but who are merely visiting The Tor Project's website (www.torproject.org), as this rule demonstrates:\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode106_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>Fingerprint to identify visitors to the Tor Project website.</em>\nThe full content of the email must already be intercepted before this code can analyze it. XKeyscore also keeps track of people who are not using Tor, but who are merely visiting The Tor Project's website (www.torproject.org), as this rule demonstrates:\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode104_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>Rules targeting people viewing the Tails or Linux Journal websites, or performing Tails-related web searches.</em>\nIt is interesting to note that this rule specifically avoids fingerprinting users believed to be located in Five Eyes countries, while other rules make no such distinction. For instance, the following fingerprint targets users visiting the Tails and Linux Journal websites, or performing certain web searches related to Tails, and makes no distinction about the country of the user.\nThe comment in the  source code above describes Tails as \"a comsec mechanism advocated by extremists on extremist forums\". In actuality, the software is used by journalists, human rights activists, and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people who merely wish to protect their privacy.\nThe rules related to Tails clearly demonstrate how easily web searches and website visits can be spied on by XKeyscore. On June 25, 2014, the United States Supreme Court noted how sensitive this type of information is in their Riley v. California decision against warrantless searches of mobile phones: \"An Internet search and browsing history [...] could reveal an individual's private interests or concerns - perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease, coupled with frequent visits to WebMD.\"\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode100_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>C++ program which searches \"raw traffic\" for .onion addresses.</em>\nIn addition to anonymous internet access, Tor also provides a mechanism for hosting anonymous internet services called \"Hidden Services\". These sites' URLs contain a domain name in the pseudo-top-level-domain \".onion\" which is only accessible using Tor. The code shown below finds and catalogs URLs for these sites which XKeyscore sees in \"raw traffic\", creating a unique fingerprint for each onion address. Each .onion address found in raw traffic is extracted and stored in an NSA database:\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode112_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>\"anonymizer/mailer/mixminion\" appid matching all connections to 128.31.0.34.</em>\nThere are also rules that target users of numerous other privacy-focused internet services, including HotSpotShield, FreeNet, Centurian, FreeProxies.org, MegaProxy, privacy.li and an anonymous email service called MixMinion as well as its predecessor MixMaster. The appid rule for MixMinion is extremely broad as it matches all traffic to or from the IP address 128.31.0.34, a server located on the MIT campus.\nThat server is operated by the Tor Project's leader Roger Dingledine, an MIT alumnus. The machine at this IP address provides many services besides MixMinion, and it is also one of the above-mentioned Tor directory authorities. Dingledine said \"That computer hosts many websites, ranging from open source gaming libraries to the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium website.\"\nSebastian Hahn, the Tor volunteer who runs Gabelmoo, was stunned to learn that his hobby could interest the NSA: \"This shows that Tor is working well enough that Tor has become a target for the intelligence services. For me this means that I will definitely go ahead with the project.\"\nWhen asked for a reaction to the findings, the Tor Project's Roger Dingledine stated the following: \"We've been thinking of state surveillance for years because of our work in places where journalists are threatened. Tor's anonymity is based on distributed trust, so observing traffic at one place in the Tor network, even a directory authority, isn't enough to break it. Tor has gone mainstream in the past few years, and its wide diversity of users - from civic-minded individuals and ordinary consumers to activists, law enforcement, and companies - is part of its security. Just learning that somebody visited the Tor or Tails website doesn't tell you whether that person is a journalist source, someone concerned that her Internet Service Provider will learn about her health conditions, or just someone irked that cat videos are blocked in her location. Trying to make a list of Tor's millions of daily users certainly counts as wide scale collection. Their attack on the bridge address distribution service shows their 'collect all the things' mentality - it's worth emphasizing that we designed bridges for users in countries like China and Iran, and here we are finding out about attacks by our own country. Does reading the contents of those mails violate the wiretap act? Now I understand how the Google engineers felt when they learned about the attacks on their infrastructure.\"\nNDR and WDR wanted to know from the NSA how it justified attacking a service funded by the U.S. government, under what legal authority Tor Network users are monitored, and whether the German government has any knowledge of the targeting of servers in Germany. Instead of adressing the questions repeatedly posed to them, the NSA provided the following statement: \"In carrying out its mission, NSA collects only what it is authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence purposes - regardless of the technical means used by foreign intelligence targets. The communications of people who are not foreign intelligence targets are of no use to the agency. In January, President Obama issued U.S. Presidential Policy Directive 28, which affirms that all persons - regardless of nationality - have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information, and that privacy and civil liberties shall be integral considerations in the planning of U.S. signals intelligence activities. The president's  directive also makes clear that the United States does not collect signals intelligence for the purpose of suppressing or burdening criticism or dissent, or for disadvantaging persons based on their ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. XKeyscore is an analytic tool that is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system. Such tools have stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels. The use of XKeyscore allows the agency to help defend the nation and protect U.S. and allied troops abroad. All of NSA's operations are conducted in strict accordance with the rule of law, including the President's new directive.\"\nHowever, the research contradicts the United States' promise to Germany that German citizens are not surveiled without suspicion. Using Tor in Germany does not justify targeting someone, the German attorney Thomas Stadler states: \"Tor users do not breach any laws, it is absolutely legitimate to act anonymously on the internet. There are many good reasons to remain anonymous.\"\n\n<blockquote><strong>What is deep packet inspection?</strong>\nDeep Packet Inspection, or DPI, refers to the class of technology which examines the content of data packets as they travel across a network. A packet is the fundamental unit of transfer in packet switched networks like the internet. While DPI is commonly used by organizations to monitor their own networks, its use on public networks for censorship and surveillance has been widely condemned by privacy advocates and the United States government alike.\nIn 2012, the head of the U.S. Delegation to the World Conference on International Telecommunications, U.S. Ambassador Terry Kramer, said \"some companies have used deep packet inspection technologies to not look at aggregate customer information, traffic information, et cetera, but to look at individual customer information. So looking at individuals and what sites they're on and how much capacity they're using, et cetera, as you can imagine, we're very much opposed to that because we feel that's a violation of people's privacy and gets into, obviously, censorship, et cetera\".\nDespite its public political condemnations of invasive DPI use, the United States \"Intelligence Community\" and its \"Five Eyes\" partners (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) operate massive internet-scale DPI systems themselves, including XKeyscore. The use of XKeyscore is not limited to these partners, however. The software has been shared with the German BND and BfV, as well as the Swedish FRA, amongst others.\n<strong>Active vs Passive</strong>\nXKeyscore and the systems that feed it are considered \"passive\", meaning that they silently listen but do not transmit anything on the networks that they are targeting. However, through a process known as \"tipping\", data from these programs can trigger other systems which perform \"active\" attacks.\nQuantum is a family of such programs, including Quantuminsert, Quantumhand, Quantumtheory, Quantumbot, and Quantumcopper, which are used for offensive computer intrusion. Turmoil, Quantum, and other components of the Turbulence architecture are running at so-called \"defensive sites\" including the Ramstein Air Force base in Germany, Yokota Air Force base in Japan, and numerous military and non-military locations within the United States.\nBoth Turmoil and XKeyscore feed selected data to real-time \"tipping\" programs, such as Trafficthief, which can both alert NSA analysts when their targets are communicating and trigger other software programs. Selected data is \"promoted\" from the local XKeyscore data store to the NSA's so-called \"corporate repositories\" for long term storage, analysis and exploitation.\n<strong>More information about XKeyscore</strong>\nIn 2013, the British newspaper The Guardian revealed that by 2008 more than 150 internet surveillance facilities around the world were running the XKeyscore Deep Packet Inspection software. All of the internet traffic observed by XKeyscore, both metadata and full content, is analyzed and stored temporarily at the collection sites for periods ranging from days to weeks, while selected data is forwarded on to other locations for long-term storage.\nThe storage, indexing, and querying functions are performed at or near the collection sites because the volume of data being collected is too large to forward everything back to facilities in other countries. Analysts working from various locations around the world may search specific XKeyscore sites, or send their queries to a collection of sites.\nXKeyscore provides a modular architecture in which tens of thousands of small computer programs, or rules, written in XKeyscore's specialized programming languages called Genesis and XKScript as well as general-purpose languages such as C++ and Python, are run against all traffic to categorize it and extract data. This indexing of the \"full take\" allows analysts to query the temporary storage stored at the XKeyscore site, effectively sifting through already pilfered communications which occurred before they had deemed them interesting for a specific reason. XKeyscore can be fed by several different programs, including Wealthycluster and Turmoil.\nThese programs \"sessionize\" the data, which means that individual connections, such as a request for a web page, are reconstructed from the stream of intercepted packets.\nLocations where the NSA runs XKeyscore include Special Source Operations (SSO) sites, typically found at or near major telecommunication providers' infrastructure; Special Collection Service (SCS) sites, usually located inside diplomatic facilities like embassies and consulates; and FORNSAT sites where satellite communications are intercepted. All of these types of sites are known to exist in Germany.\nOther \"Five Eyes\" partners also operate XKeyscore installations. The United Kingdom's Tempora program runs the largest instance of XKeyscore. Both the software itself and limited access to NSA databases have been shared with so-called \"3rd party\" partners including Germany. The German foreign intelligence agency BND and the domestic intelligence agency BfV are testing the Software.</blockquote>\n</div>",

Today, The Intercept is publishing 48 top-secret and other classified documents about XKEYSCORE dated up to 2013, which shed new light on the breadth, depth and functionality of this critical spy system -- one of the largest releases yet of documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\nThe NSA's XKEYSCORE program, first revealed [1] by The Guardian, sweeps up countless people's Internet searches, emails, documents, usernames and passwords, and other private communications. XKEYSCORE is fed a constant flow of Internet traffic from fiber optic cables [2] that make up the backbone of the world's communication network, among other sources, for processing. As of 2008, the surveillance system boasted approximately 150 field sites in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, Nigeria, Somalia, Pakistan, Japan, Australia, as well as many other countries, consisting of over 700 servers.\nThese servers store \"full-take data\" at the collection sites -- meaning that they captured all of the traffic collected -- and, as of 2009, stored content for 3 to 5 days and metadata for 30 to 45 days. NSA documents indicate that tens of billions of records are stored in its database. \"It is a fully distributed processing and query system that runs on machines around the world,\" an NSA briefing on XKEYSCORE says. \"At field sites, XKEYSCORE can run on multiple computers that gives it the ability to scale in both processing power and storage.\"\nXKEYSCORE also collects and processes Internet traffic from Americans, though NSA analysts are taught to avoid querying the system in ways that might result in spying on U.S. data. Experts and privacy activists, however, have long doubted that such exclusions are effective in preventing large amounts of American data from being swept up. One document The Intercept is publishing today suggests that FISA warrants have authorized \"full-take\" collection of traffic from at least some U.S. web forums.\nThe system is not limited to collecting web traffic. The 2013 document, \"VoIP Configuration and Forwarding Read Me,\" details how to forward VoIP data from XKEYSCORE into NUCLEON, NSA's repository for voice intercepts, facsimile, video and \"pre-released transcription.\" At the time, it supported more than 8,000 users globally and was made up of 75 servers absorbing 700,000 voice, fax, video and tag files per day.\nThe reach and potency of XKEYSCORE as a surveillance instrument is astonishing. The Guardian report noted that NSA itself refers to the program as its \"widest reaching\" system. In February of this year, The Intercept reported [3] that NSA and GCHQ hacked into the internal network of Gemalto, the world's largest provider of cell phone SIM cards, in order to steal millions of encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cell phone communication. XKEYSCORE played a vital role in the spies' hacking by providing government hackers access to the email accounts of Gemalto employees.\nNumerous key NSA partners, including Canada, New Zealand and the U.K., have access to the mass surveillance databases of XKEYSCORE. In March, the New Zealand Herald, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed [4] that the New Zealand government used XKEYSCORE to spy on candidates for the position of World Trade Organization director general and also members of the Solomon Islands government. [5]\nThese newly published documents demonstrate that collected communications not only include emails, chats and web-browsing traffic, but also pictures, documents, voice calls, webcam photos, web searches, advertising analytics traffic, social media traffic, botnet traffic, logged keystrokes, computer network exploitation (CNE) targeting, intercepted username and password pairs, file uploads to online services, Skype sessions and more.\n<strong>Bulk collection and population surveillance</strong>\nXKEYSCORE allows for incredibly broad surveillance of people based on perceived patterns of suspicious behavior. It is possible, for instance, to query the system to show the activities of people based on their location, nationality and websites visited. For instance, one slide displays the search \"germansinpakistn,\" showing an analyst querying XKEYSCORE for all individuals in Pakistan visiting specific German language message boards. [6]\nAs sites like Twitter and Facebook become increasingly significant in the world's day-to-day communications (a Pew study shows [7] that 71 percent of online adults in the U.S. use Facebook), they become a critical source of surveillance data. Traffic from popular social media sites is described as \"a great starting point\" for tracking individuals, according to an XKEYSCORE presentation [8] titled \"Tracking Targets on Online Social Networks.\"\nWhen intelligence agencies collect massive amounts of Internet traffic all over the world, they face the challenge of making sense of that data. The vast quantities collected make it difficult to connect the stored traffic to specific individuals.\nInternet companies have also encountered this problem and have solved it by tracking their users with identifiers that are unique to each individual, often in the form of browser cookies. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in visitors' browsers. They are used for a variety of purposes, including authenticating users (cookies make it possible to log in to websites), storing preferences, and uniquely tracking individuals even if they're using the same IP address as many other people. Websites also embed code used by third-party services to collect analytics or host ads, which also use cookies to track users. According to one slide, [9] \"Almost all websites have cookies enabled.\"\nThe NSA's ability to piggyback off of private companies' tracking of their own users is a vital instrument that allows the agency to trace the data it collects to individual users. It makes no difference if visitors switch to public Wi-Fi networks or connect to VPNs to change their IP addresses: the tracking cookie will follow them around as long as they are using the same web browser and fail to clear their cookies.\nApps that run on tablets and smartphones also use analytics services that uniquely track users. Almost every time a user sees an advertisement (in an app or in a web browser), the ad network is tracking users in the same way. A secret GCHQ and CSE program called BADASS, [10] which is similar to XKEYSCORE but with a much narrower scope, mines as much valuable information from leaky smartphone apps as possible, including unique tracking identifiers that app developers use to track their own users. In May of this year, CBC, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed [11] that XKEYSCORE was used to track smartphone connections to the app marketplaces run by Samsung and Google. Surveillance agency analysts also use other types of traffic data that gets scooped into XKEYSCORE to track people, such as Windows crash reports. [12]\nIn a statement to The Intercept, the NSA reiterated its position that such sweeping surveillance capabilities are needed to fight the War on Terror:\n\"The U.S. Government calls on its intelligence agencies to protect the United States, its citizens, and its allies from a wide array of serious threats. These threats include terrorist plots from al-Qaeda, ISIL, and others; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; foreign aggression against the United States and our allies; and international criminal organizations.\"\nIndeed, one of the specific examples of XKEYSCORE applications given in the documents is spying on Shaykh Atiyatallah, an al Qaeda senior leader and Osama bin Laden confidant. A few years before his death, Atiyatallah did what many people have often done: He googled himself. He searched his various aliases, an associate and the name of his book. As he did so, all of that information was captured by XKEYSCORE.\nXKEYSCORE has, however, also been used to spy on non-terrorist targets. The April 18, 2013 issue of the internal NSA publication Special Source Operations Weekly boasts [13] that analysts were successful in using XKEYSCORE to obtain U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's talking points prior to a meeting with President Obama.\n<strong>XKEYSCORE for hacking: easily collecting user names, passwords and much more</strong>\nXKEYSCORE plays a central role in how the U.S. government and its surveillance allies hack computer networks around the world. One top-secret 2009 NSA document describes how the system is used by the NSA to gather information for the Office of Tailored Access Operations, an NSA division responsible for Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) -- i.e., targeted hacking.\nParticularly in 2009, the hacking tactics enabled by XKEYSCORE would have yielded significant returns as use of encryption was less widespread than today. Jonathan Brossard, a security researcher and the CEO of Toucan Systems, told The Intercept: \"Anyone could be trained to do this in less than one day: they simply enter the name of the server they want to hack into XKEYSCORE, type enter, and are presented login and password pairs to connect to this machine. Done. Finito.\" Previous reporting [14] by The Intercept revealed that systems administrators are a popular target of the NSA. \"Who better to target than the person that already has the 'keys to the kingdom?'\" read a 2012 post on an internal NSA discussion board.\nThis system enables analysts to access web mail servers with remarkable ease. [15]\nThe same methods are used to steal the credentials -- user names and passwords -- of individual users of message boards. [16]\nHacker forums [17] are also monitored for people selling or using exploits and other hacking tools. While the NSA is clearly monitoring to understand the capabilities developed by its adversaries, it is also monitoring locations where such capabilities can be purchased.\nOther information gained via XKEYSCORE facilitates the remote exploitation of target computers. By extracting browser fingerprint and operating system versions from Internet traffic, the system allows analysts to quickly assess the exploitability of a target. [18] Brossard, the security researcher, said that \"NSA has built an impressively complete set of automated hacking tools for their analysts to use.\"\nGiven the breadth of information collected by XKEYSCORE, accessing and exploiting a target's online activity is a matter of a few mouse clicks. Brossard explains: \"The amount of work an analyst has to perform to actually break into remote computers over the Internet seems ridiculously reduced -- we are talking minutes, if not seconds. Simple. As easy as typing a few words in Google.\"\nThese facts bolster one of Snowden's most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by The Guardian [19] on June 9, 2013. \"I, sitting at my desk,\" said Snowden, could \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge to even the president, if I had a personal email.\"\nIndeed, training documents for XKEYSCORE repeatedly highlight how user-friendly the program is: with just a few clicks, any analyst with access to it can conduct sweeping searches simply by entering a person's email address, telephone number, name or other identifying data. There is no indication in the documents reviewed that prior approval is needed for specific searches.\nIn addition to login credentials and other target intelligence, XKEYSCORE collects router configuration information, [20] which it shares with Tailored Access Operations. The office is able to exploit routers and then feed the traffic traveling through those routers into their collection infrastructure. This allows the NSA to spy on traffic from otherwise out-of-reach networks. XKEYSCORE documents reference router configurations, and a document previously published by Der Spiegel [21] shows that \"active implants\" can be used to \"cop[y] traffic and direc[t]\" it past a passive collector.\n<strong>XKEYSCORE for counterintelligence</strong>\nBeyond enabling the collection, categorization, and querying of metadata and content, XKEYSCORE has also been used to monitor the surveillance and hacking actions of foreign nation states and to gather the fruits of their hacking. The Intercept previously reported [22] that NSA and its allies spy on hackers in order to collect what they collect.\nOnce the hacking tools and techniques of a foreign entity (for instance, South Korea) [23] are identified, analysts can then extract the country's espionage targets from XKEYSCORE, and gather information that the foreign power has managed to steal.\nMonitoring of foreign state hackers could allow the NSA to gather techniques and tools used by foreign actors, including knowledge of zero-day exploits--software bugs that allow attackers to hack into systems, and that not even the software vendor knows about--and implants. Additionally, by monitoring vulnerability reports sent to vendors such as Kaspersky, [24] the agency could learn when exploits they were actively using need to be retired because they've been discovered by a third party.\n<strong>Seizure v. searching: oversight, audit trail and the Fourth Amendment</strong>\nBy the nature of how it sweeps up information, XKEYSCORE gathers communications of Americans, despite the Fourth Amendment protection against \"unreasonable search and seizure\" -- including searching data without a warrant. The NSA says it does not target U.S. citizens' communications without a warrant, but acknowledges that it \"incidentally\" collects and reads some of it without one, minimizing the information that is retained or shared.<br/>\nBut that interpretation of the law is dubious at best.\nXKEYSCORE training documents say that the \"burden is on user/auditor to comply with USSID-18 or other rules,\" apparently including the British Human Rights Act (HRA), which protects the rights of U.K. citizens. U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 (USSID 18) is the American directive that governs \"U.S. person minimization.\"\nKurt Opsahl, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's general counsel, describes USSID 18 as \"an attempt by the intelligence community to comply with the Fourth Amendment. But it doesn't come from a court, it comes from the executive.\"\nIf, for instance, an analyst searched XKEYSCORE for all iPhone users, this query would violate USSID 18 [25] due to the inevitable American iPhone users that would be grabbed without a warrant, as the NSA's own training materials make clear.\nOpsahl believes that analysts are not prevented by technical means from making queries that violate USSID 18. \"The document discusses whether auditors will be happy or unhappy. This indicates that compliance will be achieved by after-the-fact auditing, not by preventing the search.\"\nScreenshots of the XKEYSCORE web-based user interface included in slides show that analysts see a prominent warning message: \"This system is audited for USSID 18 and Human Rights Act compliance.\" When analysts log in to the system, they see a more detailed message warning that \"an audit trail has been established and will be searched\" in response to HRA complaints, and as part of the USSID 18 and USSID 9 audit process.\nBecause the XKEYSCORE system does not appear to prevent analysts from making queries that would be in violation of these rules, Opsahl concludes that \"there's a tremendous amount of power being placed in the hands of analysts.\" And while those analysts may be subject to audits, \"at least in the short term they can still obtain information that they shouldn't have.\"\nDuring a symposium [26] in January 2015 hosted at Harvard University, Edward Snowden, who spoke via video call, said that NSA analysts are \"completely free from any meaningful oversight.\" Speaking about the people who audit NSA systems like XKEYSCORE for USSID 18 compliance, he said, \"The majority of the people who are doing the auditing are the friends of the analysts. They work in the same office. They're not full-time auditors, they're guys who have other duties assigned. There are a few traveling auditors who go around and look at the things that are out there, but really it's not robust.\"\nIn a statement to The Intercept, the NSA said:\n\"The National Security Agency's foreign intelligence operations are 1) authorized by law; 2) subject to multiple layers of stringent internal and external oversight; and 3) conducted in a manner that is designed to protect privacy and civil liberties. As provided for by Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28), all persons, regardless of their nationality, have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information. NSA goes to great lengths to narrowly tailor and focus its signals intelligence operations on the collection of communications that are most likely to contain foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information.\"\n<em>Coming next: A Look Under the Hood of XKEYSCORE</em>\n<em>Documents published with this article:</em>\n* <a

Around the world, when a person gets online to do anything -- write an email, post to a social network, browse the web or play a video game -- there's a decent chance that the Internet traffic her device sends and receives is getting collected and processed by one of XKEYSCORE's hundreds of servers scattered across the globe.\nIn order to make sense of such a massive and steady flow of information, analysts working for the National Security Agency, as well as partner spy agencies, have written thousands of snippets of code to detect different types of traffic and extract useful information from each type, according to documents dating up to 2013. For example, the system automatically detects if a given piece of traffic is an email. If it is, the system tags if it's from Yahoo or Gmail, if it contains an airline itinerary, if it's encrypted with PGP, or if the sender's language is set to Arabic, along with myriad other details.\nThis global Internet surveillance network is powered by a somewhat clunky piece of software running on clusters of Linux servers. Analysts access XKEYSCORE's web interface to search its wealth of private information, similar to how ordinary people can search Google for public information.\nBased on documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, The Intercept is shedding light on the inner workings of XKEYSCORE, one of the most extensive programs of mass surveillance in human history.\n<strong>How XKEYSCORE works under the hood</strong>\nIt is tempting to assume that expensive, proprietary operating systems and software must power XKEYSCORE, but it actually relies on an entirely open source stack. In fact, according to an analysis of an XKEYSCORE manual for new systems administrators from the end of 2012, the system may have design deficiencies that could leave it vulnerable to attack by an intelligence agency insider.\nXKEYSCORE is a piece of Linux software that is typically deployed on Red Hat servers. It uses the Apache web server and stores collected data in MySQL databases. File systems in a cluster are handled by the NFS distributed file system and the autofs service, and scheduled tasks are handled by the cron scheduling service. Systems administrators who maintain XKEYSCORE servers use SSH to connect to them, and they use tools such as rsync and vim, as well as a comprehensive command-line tool, to manage the software.\nJohn Adams, former security lead and senior operations engineer for Twitter, says that one of the most interesting things about XKEYSCORE's architecture is \"that they were able to achieve so much success with such a poorly designed system. Data ingest, day-to-day operations, and searching is all poorly designed. There are many open source offerings that would function far better than this design with very little work. Their operations team must be extremely unhappy.\"\nAnalysts connect to XKEYSCORE over HTTPS using standard web browsers such as Firefox. Internet Explorer is not supported. Analysts can log into the system with either a user ID and password or by using public key authentication.\nAs of 2009, XKEYSCORE servers were located at more than 100 field sites all over the world. Each field site consists of a cluster of servers; the exact number differs depending on how much information is being collected at that site. Sites with relatively low traffic can get by with fewer servers, but sites that spy on larger amounts of traffic require more servers to filter and parse it all. XKEYSCORE has been engineered to scale in both processing power and storage by adding more servers to a cluster. According to a 2009 document, some field sites receive over 20 terrabytes of data per day. This is the equivalent of 5.7 million songs, or over 13 thousand full-length films.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-map-125-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\n<em>This map from a 2009 top-secret presentation does not show all of XKEYSCORE's field sites.</em>\nWhen data is collected at an XKEYSCORE field site, it is processed locally and ultimately stored in MySQL databases at that site. XKEYSCORE supports a federated query system, which means that an analyst can conduct a single query from the central XKEYSCORE website, and it will communicate over the Internet to all of the field sites, running the query everywhere at once.\nThere might be security issues with the XKEYSCORE system itself as well. As hard as software developers may try, it's nearly impossible to write bug-free source code. To compensate for this, developers often rely on multiple layers of security; if attackers can get through one layer, they may still be thwarted by other layers. XKEYSCORE appears to do a bad job of this.\nWhen systems administrators log into XKEYSCORE servers to configure them, they appear to use a shared account, under the name \"oper.\" Adams notes, \"That means that changes made by an administrator cannot be logged.\" If one administrator does something malicious on an XKEYSCORE server using the \"oper\" user, it's possible that the digital trail of what was done wouldn't lead back to the administrator, since multiple operators use the account.\nThere appears to be another way an ill-intentioned systems administrator may be able to cover their tracks. Analysts wishing to query XKEYSCORE sign in via a web browser, and their searches are logged. This creates an audit trail, on which the system relies to assure that users aren't doing overly broad searches that would pull up U.S. citizens' web traffic. Systems administrators, however, are able to run MySQL queries. The documents indicate that administrators have the ability to directly query the MySQL databases, where the collected data is stored, apparently bypassing the audit trail.\n<strong>AppIDs, fingerprints and microplugins</strong>\nCollecting massive amounts of raw data is not very useful unless it is collated and organized in a way that can be searched. To deal with this problem, XKEYSCORE extracts and tags metadata and content from the raw data so that analysts can easily search it.\nThis is done by using dictionaries of rules called appIDs, fingerprints and microplugins that are written in a custom programming language called GENESIS. Each of these can be identified by a unique name that resembles a directory tree, such as \"mail/webmail/gmail,\" \"chat/yahoo,\" or \"botnet/blackenergybot/command/flood.\"\nOne document detailing XKEYSCORE appIDs and fingerprints lists several revealing examples. Windows Update requests appear to fall under the \"update_service/windows\" appID, and normal web requests fall under the \"http/get\" appID. XKEYSCORE can automatically detect Airblue travel itineraries with the \"travel/airblue\" fingerprint, and iPhone web browser traffic with the \"browser/cellphone/iphone\" fingerprint.\nPGP-encrypted messages are detected with the \"encryption/pgp/message\" fingerprint, and messages encrypted with Mojahedeen Secrets 2 (a type of encryption popular among supporters of al Qaeda) are detected with the \"encryption/mojaheden2\" fingerprint.\nWhen new traffic flows into an XKEYSCORE cluster, the system tests the intercepted data against each of these rules and stores whether the traffic matches the pattern. A slideshow presentation from 2010 says that XKEYSCORE contains almost 10,000 appIDs and fingerprints.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-app-for-that-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nAppIDs are used to identify the protocol of traffic being intercepted, while fingerprints detect a specific type of content. Each intercepted stream of traffic gets assigned up to one appID and any number of fingerprints. You can think of appIDs as categories and fingerprints as tags.\nIf multiple appIDs match a single stream of traffic, the appID with the lowest \"level\" is selected (appIDs with lower levels are more specific than appIDs with higher levels). For example, when XKEYSCORE is assessing a file attachment from Yahoo mail, all of the appIDs in the following slide will apply, however only \"mail/webmail/yahoo/attachment\" will be associated with this stream of traffic.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-appids-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nTo tie it all together, when an Arabic speaker logs into a Yahoo email address, XKEYSCORE will store \"mail/yahoo/login\" as the associated appID. This stream of traffic will match the \"mail/arabic\" fingerprint (denoting language settings), as well as the \"mail/yahoo/ymbm\" fingerprint (which detects Yahoo browser cookies).\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-appids-fingerprints-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nSometimes the GENESIS programming language, which largely relies on Boolean logic, regular expressions and a set of simple functions, isn't powerful enough to do the complex pattern-matching required to detect certain types of traffic. In these cases, as one slide puts it, \"Power users can drop in to C++ to express themselves.\" AppIDs or fingerprints that are written in C++ are called microplugins.\nHere's an example of a microplugin fingerprint for \"botnet/conficker_p2p_udp_data,\" which is tricky botnet traffic that can't be identified without complicated logic. A botnet is a collection of hacked computers, sometimes millions of them, that are controlled from a single point.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-conficker-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nHere's another microplugin that uses C++ to inspect intercepted Facebook chat messages and pull out details like the associated email address and body of the chat message.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-facebook-chat-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nOne document from 2009 describes in detail four generations of appIDs and fingerprints, which begin with only the ability to scan intercepted traffic for keywords, and end with the ability to write complex microplugins that can be deployed to field sites around the world in hours.\nIf XKEYSCORE development has continued at a similar pace over the last six years, it's likely considerably more powerful today.\nEmail the authors: micah.lee@theintercept.com, glenn.greenwald@theintercept.com, morgan@firstlook.org\n<em>Documents published with this

The breach, detailed in a secret 2010 GCHQ document, [1] gave the surveillance agencies the potential to secretly monitor a large portion of the world's cellular communications, including both voice and data.\nThe company targeted by the intelligence agencies, Gemalto, [2] is a multinational firm incorporated in the Netherlands that makes the chips used in mobile phones and next-generation credit cards. Among its clients are AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint and some 450 wireless network providers around the world. The company operates in 85 countries and has more than 40 manufacturing facilities. One of its three global headquarters is in Austin, Texas and it has a large factory in Pennsylvania.\nIn all, Gemalto produces some 2 billion SIM cards a year. Its motto is \"Security to be Free.\"\nWith these stolen encryption keys, intelligence agencies can monitor mobile communications without seeking or receiving approval from telecom companies and foreign governments. Possessing the keys also sidesteps the need to get a warrant or a wiretap, while leaving no trace on the wireless provider's network that the communications were intercepted. Bulk key theft additionally enables the intelligence agencies to unlock any previously encrypted communications they had already intercepted, but did not yet have the ability to decrypt.\nAs part of the covert operations against Gemalto, spies from GCHQ -- with support from the NSA -- mined the private communications of unwitting engineers and other company employees in multiple countries.\nGemalto was totally oblivious to the penetration of its systems -- and the spying on its employees. \"I'm disturbed, quite concerned that this has happened,\" Paul Beverly, a Gemalto executive vice president, told The Intercept. \"The most important thing for me is to understand exactly how this was done, so we can take every measure to ensure that it doesn't happen again, and also to make sure that there's no impact on the telecom operators that we have served in a very trusted manner for many years. What I want to understand is what sort of ramifications it has, or could have, on any of our customers.\" He added that \"the most important thing for us now is to understand the degree\" of the breach.\nLeading privacy advocates and security experts say that the theft of encryption keys from major wireless network providers is tantamount to a thief obtaining the master ring of a building superintendent who holds the keys to every apartment. \"Once you have the keys, decrypting traffic is trivial,\" says Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The news of this key theft will send a shock wave through the security community.\"\nBeverly said that after being contacted by The Intercept, Gemalto's internal security team began on Wednesday to investigate how their system was penetrated and could find no trace of the hacks. When asked if the NSA or GCHQ had ever requested access to Gemalto-manufactured encryption keys, Beverly said, \"I am totally unaware. To the best of my knowledge, no.\"\nAccording to one secret GCHQ slide, [3] the British intelligence agency penetrated Gemalto's internal networks, planting malware on several computers, giving GCHQ secret access. We \"believe we have their entire network,\" the slide's author boasted about the operation against Gemalto.\nAdditionally, the spy agency targeted unnamed cellular companies' core networks, giving it access to \"sales staff machines for customer information and network engineers machines for network maps.\" GCHQ also claimed the ability to manipulate the billing servers of cell companies to \"suppress\" charges in an effort to conceal the spy agency's secret actions against an individual's phone. Most significantly, GCHQ also penetrated \"authentication servers,\" allowing it to decrypt data and voice communications between a targeted individual's phone and his or her telecom provider's network. A note accompanying the slide asserted that the spy agency was \"very happy with the data so far and [was] working through the vast quantity of product.\"\nThe Mobile Handset Exploitation Team (MHET), whose existence has never before been disclosed, was formed in April 2010 to target vulnerabilities in cellphones. One of its main missions was to covertly penetrate computer networks of corporations that manufacture SIM cards, as well as those of wireless network providers. The team included operatives from both GCHQ and the NSA.\nWhile the FBI and other U.S. agencies can obtain court orders compelling U.S.-based telecom companies to allow them to wiretap or intercept the communications of their customers, on the international front this type of data collection is much more challenging. Unless a foreign telecom or foreign government grants access to their citizens' data to a U.S. intelligence agency, the NSA or CIA would have to hack into the network or specifically target the user's device for a more risky \"active\" form of surveillance that could be detected by sophisticated targets. Moreover, foreign intelligence agencies would not allow U.S. or U.K. spy agencies access to the mobile communications of their heads of state or other government officials.\n\"It's unbelievable. Unbelievable,\" said Gerard Schouw, a member of the Dutch Parliament, when told of the spy agencies' actions. Schouw, the intelligence spokesperson for D66, the largest opposition party in the Netherlands, told The Intercept, \"We don't want to have the secret services from other countries doing things like this.\" Schouw added that he and other lawmakers will ask the Dutch government to provide an official explanation and to clarify whether the country's intelligence services were aware of the targeting of Gemalto, whose official headquarters is in Amsterdam.\nLast November, the Dutch government proposed [4] an amendment to its constitution to include explicit protection for the privacy of digital communications, including those made on mobile devices. \"We have, in the Netherlands, a law on the [activities] of secret services. And hacking is not allowed,\" Schouw said. Under Dutch law, the interior minister would have to sign off on such operations by foreign governments' intelligence agencies. \"I don't believe that he has given his permission for these kind of actions.\"\nThe U.S. and British intelligence agencies pulled off the encryption key heist in great stealth, giving them the ability to intercept and decrypt communications without alerting the wireless network provider, the foreign government or the individual user that they have been targeted. \"Gaining access to a database of keys is pretty much game over for cellular encryption,\" says Matthew Green, a cryptography specialist at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute. The massive key theft is \"bad news for phone security. Really bad news.\"\nAS CONSUMERS BEGAN to adopt cellular phones en masse in the mid-1990s, there were no effective privacy protections in place. Anyone could buy a cheap device from RadioShack capable of intercepting calls placed on mobile phones. The shift from analog to digital networks introduced basic encryption technology, though it was still crackable by tech savvy computer science graduate students, as well as the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, using readily available equipment.\nToday, second-generation (2G) phone technology, which relies on a deeply flawed encryption system, remains the dominant platform globally, though U.S. and European cellphone companies now use 3G, 4G and LTE technology in urban areas. These include more secure, though not invincible, methods of encryption, and wireless carriers throughout the world are upgrading their networks to use these newer technologies.\nIt is in the context of such growing technical challenges to data collection that intelligence agencies, such as the NSA, have become interested in acquiring cellular encryption keys. \"With old-fashioned [2G], there are other ways to work around cellphone security without those keys,\" says Green, the Johns Hopkins cryptographer. \"With newer 3G, 4G and LTE protocols, however, the algorithms aren't as vulnerable, so getting those keys would be essential.\"\nThe privacy of all mobile communications -- voice calls, text messages and Internet access -- depends on an encrypted connection between the cellphone and the wireless carrier's network, using keys stored on the SIM, a tiny chip smaller than a postage stamp, which is inserted into the phone. All mobile communications on the phone depend on the SIM, which stores and guards the encryption keys created by companies like Gemalto. SIM cards can be used to store contacts, text messages, and other important data, like one's phone number. In some countries, SIM cards are used to transfer money. As The Intercept reported [5] last year, having the wrong SIM card can make you the target of a drone strike.\nSIM cards were not invented to protect individual communications -- they were designed to do something much simpler: ensure proper billing and prevent fraud, which was pervasive in the early days of cellphones. Soghoian compares the use of encryption keys on SIM cards to the way Social Security numbers are used today. \"Social security numbers were designed in the 1930s to track your contributions to your government pension,\" he says. \"Today they are used as a quasi national identity number, which was never their intended purpose.\"\nBecause the SIM card wasn't created with call confidentiality in mind, the manufacturers and wireless carriers don't make a great effort to secure their supply chain. As a result, the SIM card is an extremely vulnerable component of a mobile phone. \"I doubt anyone is treating those things very carefully,\" says Green. \"Cell companies probably don't treat them as essential security tokens. They probably just care that nobody is defrauding their networks.\" The ACLU's Soghoian adds, \"These keys are so valuable that it makes sense for intel agencies to go after them.\"\nAs a general rule, phone companies do not manufacture SIM cards, nor program them with secret encryption keys. It is cheaper and more efficient for them to outsource this sensitive step in the SIM card production process. They purchase them in bulk with the keys pre-loaded by other corporations. Gemalto is the largest of these SIM \"personalization\" companies.\nAfter a SIM card is manufactured, the encryption key, known as a \"Ki,\" is burned directly onto the chip. A copy of the key is also given to the cellular provider, allowing its network to recognize an individual's phone. In order for the phone to be able to connect to the wireless carrier's network, the phone -- with the help of the SIM -- authenticates itself using the Ki that has been programmed onto the SIM. The phone conducts a secret \"handshake\" that validates that the Ki on the SIM matches the Ki held by the mobile company. Once that happens, the communications between the phone and the network are encrypted. Even if GCHQ or the NSA were to intercept the phone signals as they are transmitted through the air, the intercepted data would be a garbled mess. Decrypting it can be challenging and time-consuming. Stealing the keys, on the other hand, is beautifully simple, from the intelligence agencies' point of view, as the pipeline for producing and distributing SIM cards was never designed to thwart mass surveillance efforts.\nOne of the creators of the encryption protocol that is widely used today for securing emails, Adi Shamir, famously asserted: \"Cryptography is typically bypassed, not penetrated.\" In other words, it is much easier (and sneakier) to open a locked door when you have the key than it is to break down the door using brute force. While the NSA and GCHQ have substantial resources dedicated to breaking encryption, it is not the only way -- and certainly not always the most efficient -- to get at the data they want. \"NSA has more mathematicians on its payroll than any other entity in the U.S.,\" says the ACLU's Soghoian. \"But the NSA's hackers are way busier than its mathematicians.\"\nGCHQ and the NSA could have taken any number of routes to steal SIM encryption keys and other data. They could have physically broken into a manufacturing plant. They could have broken into a wireless carrier's office. They could have bribed, blackmailed or coerced an employee of the manufacturer or cellphone provider. But all of that comes with substantial risk of exposure. In the case of Gemalto, hackers working for GCHQ remotely penetrated the company's computer network in order to steal the keys in bulk as they were en route to the wireless network providers.\nSIM card \"personalization\" companies like Gemalto ship hundreds of thousands of SIM cards at a time to mobile phone operators across the world. International shipping records obtained by The Intercept show that in 2011, Gemalto shipped 450,000 smart cards from its plant in Mexico to Germany's Deutsche Telekom in just one shipment.\nIn order for the cards to work and for the phones' communications to be secure, Gemalto also needs to provide the mobile company with a file containing the encryption keys for each of the new SIM cards. These master key files could be shipped via FedEx, DHL, UPS or another snail mail provider. More commonly, they could be sent via email or through File Transfer Protocol, FTP, a method of sending files over the Internet.\nThe moment the master key set is generated by Gemalto or another personalization company, but before it is sent to the wireless carrier, is the most vulnerable moment for interception. \"The value of getting them at the point of manufacture is you can presumably get a lot of keys in one go, since SIM chips get made in big batches,\" says Green, the cryptographer. \"SIM cards get made for lots of different carriers in one facility.\" In Gemalto's case, GCHQ hit the jackpot, as the company manufactures SIMs for hundreds of wireless network providers, including all of the leading U.S.-- and many of the largest European -- companies.\nBut obtaining the encryption keys while Gemalto still held them required finding a way into the company's internal systems.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2015/key-slide-540x351.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 351px;\"/>\n<em>Diagram from a top-secret GCHQ slide.</em><br/>\n<br/>TOP-SECRET GCHQ documents reveal that the intelligence agencies accessed the email and Facebook accounts of engineers and other employees of major telecom corporations and SIM card manufacturers in an effort to secretly obtain information that could give them access to millions of encryption keys. They did this by utilizing the NSA's X-KEYSCORE program, which allowed them access to private emails hosted by the SIM card and mobile companies' servers, as well as those of major tech corporations, including Yahoo and Google.\nIn effect, GCHQ clandestinely cyberstalked [6] Gemalto employees, scouring their emails in an effort to find people who may have had access to the company's core networks and Ki-generating systems. The intelligence agency's goal was to find information that would aid in breaching Gemalto's systems, making it possible to steal large quantities of encryption keys. The agency hoped to intercept the files containing the keys as they were transmitted between Gemalto and its wireless network provider customers.\nGCHQ operatives identified key individuals and their positions within Gemalto and then dug into their emails. In one instance, GCHQ zeroed in on a Gemalto employee in Thailand who they observed sending PGP-encrypted files, noting that if GCHQ wanted to expand its Gemalto operations, \"he would certainly be a good place to start.\" They did not claim to have decrypted the employee's communications, but noted that the use of PGP could mean the contents were potentially valuable.\nThe cyberstalking was not limited to Gemalto. GCHQ operatives wrote a script that allowed the agency to mine the private communications of employees of major telecommunications and SIM \"personalization\" companies for technical terms used in the assigning of secret keys to mobile phone customers. Employees for the SIM card manufacturers and wireless network providers were labeled as \"known individuals and operators targeted\" in a top-secret GCHQ document.\nAccording to that April 2010 document, [7] \"PCS Harvesting at Scale,\" hackers working for GCHQ focused on \"harvesting\" massive amounts of individual encryption keys \"in transit between mobile network operators and SIM card personalisation centres\" like Gemalto. The spies \"developed a methodology for intercepting these keys as they are transferred between various network operators and SIM card providers.\" By that time, GCHQ had developed \"an automated technique with the aim of increasing the volume of keys that can be harvested.\"\nThe PCS Harvesting document acknowledged that, in searching for information on encryption keys, GCHQ operatives would undoubtedly vacuum up \"a large number of unrelated items\" from the private communications of targeted employees. \"[H]owever an analyst with good knowledge of the operators involved can perform this trawl regularly and spot the transfer of large batches of [keys].\"\nThe document noted that many SIM card manufacturers transferred the encryption keys to wireless network providers \"by email or FTP with simple encryption methods that can be broken ... or occasionally with no encryption at all.\" To get bulk access to encryption keys, all the NSA or GCHQ needed to do was intercept emails or file transfers as they were sent over the Internet -- something both agencies already do millions of times per day. A footnote in the 2010 document observed that the use of \"strong encryption products ... is becoming increasingly common\" in transferring the keys.\nIn its key harvesting \"trial\" operations in the first quarter of 2010, GCHQ successfully intercepted [8] keys used by wireless network providers in Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, India, Serbia, Iceland and Tajikistan. But, the agency noted, its automated key harvesting system failed to produce results against Pakistani networks, denoted as \"priority targets\" in the document, despite the fact that GCHQ had a store of Kis from two providers in the country, Mobilink and Telenor. \"[I]t is possible that these networks now use more secure methods to transfer Kis,\" the document concluded.\nFrom December 2009 through March 2010, a month before the Mobile Handset Exploitation Team was formed, GCHQ conducted a number of trials aimed at extracting encryption keys and other personalized data for individual phones. In one two-week period, they accessed the emails of 130 people associated with wireless network providers or SIM card manufacturing and personalization. This operation produced nearly 8,000 keys matched to specific phones in 10 countries. In another two-week period, by mining just six email addresses, they produced 85,000 keys. At one point in March 2010, GCHQ intercepted nearly 100,000 keys for mobile phone users in Somalia. By June, they'd compiled [9] 300,000. \"Somali providers are not on GCHQ's list of interest,\" the document noted. \"[H]owever, this was usefully shared with NSA.\"\nThe GCHQ documents only contain statistics for three months of encryption key theft in 2010. During this period, millions of keys were harvested. The documents stated explicitly that GCHQ had already created a constantly evolving automated process for bulk harvesting of keys. They describe active operations targeting Gemalto's personalization centers across the globe, as well as other major SIM card manufacturers and the private communications of their employees.\nA top-secret NSA document asserted that, as of 2009, the U.S. spy agency already had the capacity to process between 12 and 22 million keys per second for later use against surveillance targets. In the future, the agency predicted, it would be capable of processing more than 50 million per second. The document did not state how many keys were actually processed, just that the NSA had the technology to perform such swift, bulk operations. It is impossible to know how many keys have been stolen by the NSA and GCHQ to date, but, even using conservative math, the numbers are likely staggering.\nGCHQ assigned \"scores\" to more than 150 individual email addresses based on how often the users mentioned certain technical terms, and then intensified the mining of those individuals' accounts based on priority. The highest-scoring email address was that of an employee of Chinese tech giant Huawei, which the U.S. has repeatedly accused of collaborating with Chinese intelligence. In all, GCHQ harvested the emails of employees of hardware companies that manufacture phones, such as Ericsson and Nokia; operators of mobile networks, such as MTN Irancell and Belgacom; SIM card providers, such as Bluefish and Gemalto; and employees of targeted companies who used email providers, such as Yahoo and Google. During the three-month trial, the largest number of email addresses harvested were those belonging to Huawei employees, followed by MTN Irancell. The third largest class of emails harvested in the trial were private Gmail accounts, presumably belonging to employees at targeted companies.\nThe GCHQ program targeting Gemalto was called DAPINO GAMMA. In 2011, GCHQ launched operation HIGHLAND FLING to mine the email accounts of Gemalto employees in France and Poland. A top-secret document on the operation stated that one of the aims was \"getting into French HQ\" of Gemalto \"to get in to core data repositories.\" France, home to one of Gemalto's global headquarters, is the nerve center of the company's worldwide operations. Another goal was to intercept private communications of employees in Poland that \"could lead to penetration into one or more personalisation centers\" -- the factories where the encryption keys are burned onto SIM cards.\nAs part of these operations, GCHQ operatives acquired the usernames and passwords for Facebook accounts of Gemalto targets. An internal top-secret GCHQ wiki on the program from May 2011 indicated that GCHQ was in the process of \"targeting\" more than a dozen Gemalto facilities across the globe, including in Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Italy, Russia, Sweden, Spain, Japan and Singapore.\nThe document also stated that GCHQ was preparing similar key theft operations against one of Gemalto's competitors, Germany-based SIM card giant Giesecke and Devrient.\nOn January 17, 2014, President Barack Obama gave a major address on the NSA spying scandal. \"The bottom line is that people around the world, regardless of their nationality, should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don't threaten our national security and that we take their privacy concerns into account in our policies and procedures,\" he said.\nThe monitoring of the lawful communications of employees of major international corporations shows that such statements by Obama, other U.S. officials and British leaders -- that they only intercept and monitor the communications of known or suspected criminals or terrorists -- were untrue. \"The NSA and GCHQ view the private communications of people who work for these companies as fair game,\" says the ACLU's Soghoian. \"These people were specifically hunted and targeted by intelligence agencies, not because they did anything wrong, but because they could be used as a means to an end.\"\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"491\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2015/key-slide2.png\" width=\"900\"/>\nTHERE ARE TWO basic types of electronic or digital surveillance: passive and active. All intelligence agencies engage in extensive passive surveillance, which means they collect bulk data by intercepting communications sent over fiber-optic cables, radio waves or wireless devices.\nIntelligence agencies place high-power antennas, known as \"spy nests,\" on the top of their countries' embassies and consulates, which are capable of vacuuming up data sent to or from mobile phones in the surrounding area. The joint NSA/CIA Special Collection Service is the lead entity that installs and mans these nests for the United States. An embassy situated near a parliament or government agency could easily intercept the phone calls and data transfers of the mobile phones used by foreign government officials. The U.S. embassy in Berlin, for instance, is located a stone's throw from the Bundestag. But if the wireless carriers are using stronger encryption, which is built into modern 3G, 4G and LTE networks, then intercepted calls and other data would be more difficult to crack, particularly in bulk. If the intelligence agency wants to actually listen to or read what is being transmitted, they would need to decrypt the encrypted data.\nActive surveillance is another option. This would require government agencies to \"jam\" a 3G or 4G network, forcing nearby phones onto 2G. Once forced down to the less secure 2G technology, the phone can be tricked into connecting to a fake cell tower operated by an intelligence agency. This method of surveillance, though effective, is risky, as it leaves a digital trace that counter-surveillance experts from foreign governments could detect.\nStealing the Kis solves all of these problems. This way, intelligence agencies can safely engage in passive, bulk surveillance without having to decrypt data and without leaving any trace whatsoever.\n\"Key theft enables the bulk, low-risk surveillance of encrypted communications,\" the ACLU's Soghoian says. \"Agencies can collect all the communications and then look through them later. With the keys, they can decrypt whatever they want, whenever they want. It's like a time machine, enabling the surveillance of communications that occurred before someone was even a target.\"\nNeither the NSA nor GCHQ would comment specifically on the key theft operations. In the past, they have argued more broadly that breaking encryption is a necessary part of tracking terrorists and other criminals. \"It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters,\" a GCHQ official stated in an email, adding that the agency's work is conducted within a \"strict legal and policy framework\" that ensures its activities are \"authorized, necessary and proportionate,\" with proper oversight, which is the standard response the agency has provided for previous stories published by The Intercept. The agency also said, \"[T]he UK's interception regime is entirely compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.\" The NSA declined to offer any comment.\nIt is unlikely that GCHQ's pronouncement about the legality of its operations will be universally embraced in Europe. \"It is governments massively engaging in illegal activities,\" says Sophie in't Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament. \"If you are not a government and you are a student doing this, you will end up in jail for 30 years.\" Veld, who chaired the European Parliament's recent inquiry into mass surveillance exposed by Snowden, told The Intercept: \"The secret services are just behaving like cowboys. Governments are behaving like cowboys and nobody is holding them to account.\"\nThe Intercept's Laura Poitras has previously reported [10] that in 2013 Australia's signals intelligence agency, a close partner of the NSA, stole some 1.8 million encryption keys from an Indonesian wireless carrier.\nA few years ago, the FBI reportedly [11] dismantled several transmitters set up by foreign intelligence agencies around the Washington, D.C. area, which could be used to intercept cellphone communications. Russia, China, Israel and other nations use similar technology as the NSA across the world. If those governments had the encryption keys for major U.S. cellphone companies' customers, such as those manufactured by Gemalto, mass snooping would be simple. \"It would mean that with a few antennas placed around Washington, D.C., the Chinese or Russian governments could sweep up and decrypt the communications of members of Congress, U.S. agency heads, reporters, lobbyists and everyone else involved in the policymaking process and decrypt their telephone conversations,\" says Soghoian.\n\"Put a device in front of the U.N., record every bit you see going over the air. Steal some keys, you have all those conversations,\" says Green, the Johns Hopkins cryptographer. And it's not just spy agencies that would benefit from stealing encryption keys. \"I can only imagine how much money you could make if you had access to the calls made around Wall Street,\" he adds.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2015/gemalto-slide-540x404.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 404px;\"/>\n<em>GCHQ slide.</em><br/>\n<br/>THE BREACH OF Gemalto's computer network by GCHQ has far-reaching global implications. The company, which brought in $2.7 billion in revenue in 2013, is a global leader in digital security, producing banking cards, mobile payment systems, two-factor authentication devices used for online security, hardware tokens used for securing buildings and offices, electronic passports and identification cards. It provides chips to Vodafone in Europe and France's Orange, as well as EE, a joint venture in the U.K. between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. Royal KPN, the largest Dutch wireless network provider, also uses Gemalto technology.\nIn Asia, Gemalto's chips are used by China Unicom, Japan's NTT and Taiwan's Chungwa Telecom, as well as scores of wireless network providers throughout Africa and the Middle East. The company's security technology is used by more than 3,000 financial institutions and 80 government organizations. Among its clients are Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JP Morgan Chase and Barclays. It also provides chips for use in luxury cars, including those made by Audi and BMW.\nIn 2012, Gemalto won a sizable contract, worth $175 million, from the U.S. government to produce the covers for electronic U.S. passports, which contain chips and antennas that can be used to better authenticate travelers. As part of its contract, Gemalto provides the personalization and software for the microchips implanted in the passports. The U.S. represents Gemalto's single largest market, accounting for some 15 percent of its total business. This raises the question of whether GCHQ, which was able to bypass encryption on mobile networks, has the ability to access private data protected by other Gemalto products created for banks and governments.\nAs smart phones become smarter, they are increasingly replacing credit cards and cash as a means of paying for goods and services. When Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile formed an alliance in 2010 to jointly build an electronic pay system to challenge Google Wallet and Apple Pay, they purchased Gemalto's technology for their program, known as Softcard. (Until July 2014, it previously went by the unfortunate name of \"ISIS Mobile Wallet.\") Whether data relating to that, and other Gemalto security products, has been compromised by GCHQ and the NSA is unclear. Both intelligence agencies declined to answer any specific questions for this story.\nPRIVACY ADVOCATES and security experts say it would take billions of dollars, significant political pressure, and several years to fix the fundamental security flaws in the current mobile phone system that NSA, GCHQ and other intelligence agencies regularly exploit.\nA current gaping hole in the protection of mobile communications is that cellphones and wireless network providers do not support the use of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), a form of encryption designed to limit the damage caused by theft or disclosure of encryption keys. PFS, which is now built into modern web browsers and used by sites like Google and Twitter, works by generating unique encryption keys for each communication or message, which are then discarded. Rather than using the same encryption key to protect years' worth of data, as the permanent Kis on SIM cards can, a new key might be generated each minute, hour or day, and then promptly destroyed. Because cellphone communications do not utilize PFS, if an intelligence agency has been \"passively\" intercepting someone's communications for a year and later acquires the permanent encryption key, it can go back and decrypt all of those communications. If mobile phone networks were using PFS, that would not be possible -- even if the permanent keys were later stolen.\nThe only effective way for individuals to protect themselves from Ki theft-enabled surveillance is to use secure communications software, rather than relying on SIM card-based security. Secure software includes email and other apps that use Transport Layer Security (TLS), the mechanism underlying the secure HTTPS web protocol. The email clients included with Android phones and iPhones support TLS, as do large email providers like Yahoo and Google.\nApps like TextSecure and Silent Text are secure alternatives to SMS messages, while Signal, RedPhone and Silent Phone encrypt voice calls. Governments still may be able to intercept communications, but reading or listening to them would require hacking a specific handset, obtaining internal data from an email provider, or installing a bug in a room to record the conversations.\n\"We need to stop assuming that the phone companies will provide us with a secure method of making calls or exchanging text messages,\" says Soghoian.\n<em>Documents published with this article:</em>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/cne-access-core-mobile-networks-2/\"><strong>CNE Access to Core Mobile Networks</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/keys/\"><strong>Where Are These Keys?</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-successes-jan10-mar10-trial/\"><strong>CCNE Successes Jan10-Mar10 Trial</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/dapino-gamma-cne-presence-wiki/\"><strong>DAPINO GAMMA CNE Presence Wiki</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/dapino-gamma-gemalto-yuaawaa-wiki/\"><strong>DAPINO GAMMA Gemalto Yuaawaa Wiki</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <strong><a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/dapino-gamma-target-personalisation-centres-gemalto-wiki/\">DAPINO GAMMA Target Personalisation Centres Gemalto Wiki</a></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/imsis-identified-ki-data-network-providers-jan10-mar10-trial/\"><strong>IMSIs Identified with Ki Data for Network Providers Jan10-Mar10 Trial</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-stats-summaries-jan10-mar10-trial/\"><strong>CCNE Stats Summaries Jan10-Mar10 Trial</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-email-harvesting-jan10-mar10-trial/\"><strong>CCNE Email Harvesting Jan10-Mar10 Trial</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-email-addresses-jan10-mar10-trial/\"><strong>CCNE Email Addresses Jan10-Mar10 Trial</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/pcs-harvesting-scale/\"><strong>PCS Harvesting at Scale</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional reporting by Andrew Fishman and Ryan Gallagher.

The German newsweekly did not write about the BADASS document, attaching it to a broader article [2] on cyberwarfare. According to The Intercept's analysis of the document, intelligence agents applied BADASS software filters to streams of intercepted internet traffic, plucking from that traffic unencrypted uploads from smartphones to servers run by advertising and analytics companies.\nProgrammers frequently embed code from a handful of such companies into their smartphone apps because it helps them answer a variety of questions: How often does a particular user open the app, and at what time of day? Where does the user live? Where does the user work? Where is the user right now? What's the phone's unique identifier? What version of Android or iOS is the device running? What's the user's IP address? Answers to those questions guide app upgrades and help target advertisements, benefits that help explain why tracking users is not only routine in the tech industry but also considered a best practice.\nFor users, however, the smartphone data routinely provided to ad and analytics companies represents a major privacy threat. When combined together, the information fragments can be used to identify specific users, and when concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies, they have proven to be irresistibly convenient targets for those engaged in mass surveillance. Although the BADASS presentation appears to be roughly four years old, at least one player in the mobile advertising and analytics space, Google, acknowledges that its servers still routinely receive unencrypted uploads from Google code embedded in apps.\nFor spy agencies, this smartphone monitoring data represented a new, convenient way of learning more about surveillance targets, including information about their physical movements and digital activities. It also would have made it possible to design more focused cyberattacks against those people, for example by exploiting a weakness in a particular app known to be used by a particular person. Such scenarios are strongly hinted at in a 2010 NSA presentation, [3] provided by agency whistleblower Edward Snowden and published last year in The New York Times, Pro Publica, and The Guardian. That presentation stated that smartphone monitoring would be useful because it could lead to \"additional exploitation\" and the unearthing of \"target knowledge/leads, location, [and] target technology.\"\nThe 2010 presentation, along with additional documents from Britain's intelligence service Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, showed that the intelligence agencies were aggressively ramping up their efforts to see into the world of mobile apps. But the specifics of how they might distill useful information from the torrent of internet packets to and from smartphones remained unclear.\n<strong>Encrypting Data in Transit</strong>\nThe BADASS slides fill in some of these blanks. They appear to have been presented in 2011 at the highly secretive SIGDEV intelligence community conference. The presentation states that \"analytics firm Flurry estimates that 250,000 Motorola Droid phones were sold in the United States during the phone's first week in stores,\" and asks, \"how do they know that?\"\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"675\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass1-1000x750.png\" width=\"900\"/>\nThe answer is that during the week in question, Flurry uploaded to its own servers analytics from Droid phones on behalf of app developers, one phone at a time, and stored the analytics in their own databases. Analytics includes any information that is available to the app and that can conceivably help improve it, including, in certain instances with Flurry, the user's age and gender, physical location, how long they left the app open, and a unique identifier for the phone, according to Flurry materials included in the BADASS document.\nBy searching these databases, the company was able to get a count of Droid phones running Flurry-enabled apps and, by extrapolating, estimate the total number of Droids in circulation. The company can find similar information about any smartphone that their analytics product supports.\nNot only was Flurry vacuuming sensitive data up to its servers, it was doing so insecurely. When a smartphone app collects data about the device it's running on and sends it back to a tracking company, it generally uses the HTTP protocol, and Flurry-enabled apps were no exception. But HTTP is inherently insecure--eavesdroppers can easily spy on the entire digital conversation.\nIf the tracking data was always phoned home using the HTTPS protocol--the same as the HTTP protocol, except that the stream of traffic between the phone and the server is encrypted--then the ability for spy agencies to collect tracking data with programs like BADASS would be severely impeded.\nYahoo, which acquired the analytics firm Flurry in late 2014, says that since acquiring the company they have \"implemented default encryption between Flurry-enabled applications and Flurry servers. The 2010 report in question does not apply to current versions of Flurry's analytics product.\" Given that Yahoo acquired Flurry so recently, it's unclear how many apps still use Flurry's older tracking code that sends unencrypted data back to Yahoo's servers. (Yahoo declined to elaborate specifically on that topic.)\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass10-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/>\nThe BADASS slides also use Google's advertisement network AdMob as an example of intercepted, unencrypted data. Free smartphone apps are often supported by ads, and if the app uses AdMob then it sends some identifying information to AdMob's servers while loading the ad. Google currently supports the ability for app developers to turn on HTTPS for ad requests, [4] however it's clear that only some AdMob users actually do this.\nWhen asked about HTTPS support for AdMob, a Google spokesperson said, \"We continue our ongoing efforts to encrypt all Google products and services.\"\nIn addition to Yahoo's Flurry and Google's AdMob, the BADASS presentation also shows that British and Canadian intelligence were targeting Mobclix, Mydas, Medialets, and MSN Mobile Advertising. But it's clear that any mobile-related plaintext traffic from any company is a potential target. While the BADASS presentation focuses on traffic from analytics and ad companies, it also shows spying on Google Maps heartbeat traffic, and capturing \"beacons\" sent out when apps are first opened (listing Qriously, Com2Us, Fluentmobile, and Papayamobile as examples). The BADASS presentation also mentions capturing GPS coordinates that get leaked when opening BlackBerry's app store.\nIn a boilerplate statement, GCHQ said, \"It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters. Furthermore, all of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight.\" Its Canadian counterpart, Communications Security Establishment Canada, or CSEC, responded with a statement that read, in part, \"For reasons of national security, CSE cannot comment on its methods, techniques or capabilities. CSE conducts foreign intelligence and cyber defence activities in compliance with Canadian law.\"\nJulia Angwin, who has doggedly investigated online privacy issues as a journalist and author, most recently of the book \"Dragnet Nation,\" explains that \"every type of unique identifier that passes [over the internet] unencrypted is giving away information about users to anyone who wants it,\" and that \"the evidence is clear that it's very risky to be throwing unique identifiers out there in the clear. Anyone can grab them. This is more evidence that no one should be doing that.\"\n<strong>Building Haystacks to Search for Needles</strong>\nThe BADASS program was created not merely to track advertising and analytic data but to solve a much bigger problem: There is an overwhelming amount of smartphone tracking data being collected by intelligence agencies, and it's difficult to make sense of.\nFirst there are the major platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry. On each platform, a range of hardware and platform versions are in use. Additionally, app stores are overflowing; new apps that track people get released every day. Old apps constantly get updated to track people in different ways, and people use different versions of apps for different platforms all at once. Adding to the diversity, there are several different ad and analytics companies that app developers use, and when those companies send tracking data back to their servers, they use a wide variety of formats.\nWith such an unwieldy haystack of data, GCHQ and CSEC, started the BADASS program, according to the presentation, to find the needles: information that can uniquely identify people and their devices, such as smartphone identifiers, tracking cookies, and other unique strings, as well as personally identifying information like GPS coordinates and email addresses.\nBADASS is an an acryonym that stands for BEGAL Automated Deployment And Survey System. (It is not clear what \"BEGAL\" stands for, in turn.) The slideshow presentation is called \"Mobile apps doubleheader: BADASS Angry Birds,\" and promises \"protocols exploitation in a rapidly changing world.\"\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass2-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/>\n<strong>Exploiting Protocols in a Rapidly Changing World</strong>\nAnalysts are able to write BADASS \"rules\" that look for specific types of tracking information as it travels across the internet.\nFor example, when someone opens an app that loads an ad, their phone normally sends an unencrypted web request (called an HTTP request) to the ad network's servers. If this request gets intercepted by spy agencies and fed into the BADASS program, it then gets filtered through each rule to see if one applies to the request. If it finds a match, BADASS can then automatically pull out the juicy information.\nIn the following slide, the information that is potentially available in a single HTTP request to load an ad includes which platform the ad is being loaded on (Android, iOS, etc.), the unique identifier of the device, the IMEI [5] number which cell towers use to identify phones that try to connect to them, the name and version of the operating system that's running, the model of the device, and latitude and longitude location data.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass3-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/>\nSimilar information is sent across the internet in HTTP requests in several different formats depending on what company it's being sent to, what device it's running on, and what version of the ad or analytics software is being used. Because this is constantly changing, analysts can write their own BADASS rules to capture all of the permutations they can find.\nThe following slide shows part of the BADASS user interface, and a partial list of rules.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass4-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/>\nThe slideshow includes a section called \"Abusing BADASS for Fun and Profit\" which goes into detail about the methodology analysts use to write new BADASS rules.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass5-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/><br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass6-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/><br/>\n<br/>By looking at intercepted HTTP traffic and writing rules to parse it, analysts can quickly gather as much information as possibly from leaky smartphone apps. One slide states: \"Creativity, iterative testing, domain knowledge, and the right tools can help us target multiple platforms in a very short time period.\"\n<strong>Privacy Policies That Don't Deliver</strong>\nThe slides also appear to mock the privacy promises of ad and analytics companies.\nCompanies that collect usage statistics about software often insist that the data is anonymous because they don't include identifying information such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses of the users that they're tracking. But in reality, sending unique device identifiers, IP addresses, IMEI numbers, and GPS coordinates of devices is far from anonymous. [6]\nIn one slide, the phrase \"anonymous usage statistics\" appears in conspicuous quotation marks. The spies are well aware that despite not including specific types of information, the data they collect from leaky smartphone apps is enough for them to uniquely identify their targets.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass7-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/>\nThe following slides show a chunk of Flurry's privacy policy (at this point it has been replaced by Yahoo's privacy policy), which states what information it collects from devices and how it believes this is anonymous.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass8-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/><br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass9-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/><br/>\n<br/>The red box, which is present in the original slides, highlights this part: \"None of this information can identify the individual. No names, phone numbers, email addresses, or anything else considered personally identifiable information is ever collected.\"\nClearly the intelligence services disagree.\n\"Commercial surveillance often appears very benign,\" Angwin says. \"The reason Flurry exists is not to 'spy on people' but to help people learn who's using their apps. But what we've also seen through Snowden revelations is that spy agencies seek to use that for their own purposes.\"\n<strong>The Web has the Exact Same Problems</strong>\nWhile the BADASS program is specifically designed to target smartphone traffic, websites suffer from these exact same problems, and in many cases they're even worse.\nWebsites routinely include bits of tracking code from several different companies for ads, analytics, and other behavioral tracking. This, combined with the lack of HTTPS, turns your web browser into a surveillance device that follows you around, even if you switch networks or use proxy servers.\nIn other words, while the BADASS presentation may be four years old, and while it's been a year and a half since Snowden's leaks began educating technology companies and users about the massive privacy threats they face, the big privacy holes exploited by BADASS remain a huge problem.\n[1] <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35670.pdf\">http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35670.pdf</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/new-snowden-docs-indicate-scope-of-nsa-preparations-for-cyber-battle-a-1013409.html\">http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/new-snowden-docs-indicate-scope-of-nsa-preparations-for-cyber-battle-a-1013409.html</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/28/world/28mobile-annotateA.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/28/world/28mobile-annotateA.html</a>\n[4] <a href=\"https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6110580?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3052727\">https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6110580?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3052727</a>\n[5] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Station_Equipment_Identity\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Station_Equipment_Identity</a>\n[6] <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/primer-information-theory-and-privacy\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/primer-information-theory-and-privacy</a>\n</div>",

Documents from Edward Snowden show that the intelligence agency is arming America for future digital wars -- a struggle for control of the Internet that is already well underway.<br/>\n<br/>By Jacob Appelbaum, Aaron Gibson, Claudio Guarnieri, Andy Muller-Maguhn, Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, Leif Ryge, Hilmar Schmundt and Michael Sontheimer\nNormally, internship applicants need to have polished resumes, with volunteer work on social projects considered a plus. But at Politerain, the job posting calls for candidates with significantly different skill sets. We are, the ad says, \"looking for interns who want to break things.\"\nPoliterain is not a project associated with a conventional company. It is run by a US government intelligence organization, the National Security Agency (NSA). More precisely, it's operated by the NSA's digital snipers with Tailored Access Operations [1] (TAO), the department responsible for breaking into computers.\nPotential interns are also told that research into third party computers might include plans to \"remotely degrade or destroy opponent computers, routers, servers and network enabled devices by attacking the hardware.\" Using a program called Passionatepolka, for example, they may be asked to \"remotely brick network cards.\" With programs like Berserkr they would implant \"persistent backdoors\" and \"parasitic drivers\". Using another piece of software called Barnfire, they would \"erase the BIOS on a brand of servers that act as a backbone to many rival governments.\"\nAn intern's tasks might also include remotely destroying the functionality of hard drives. Ultimately, the goal of the internship program was \"developing an attacker's mindset.\"\nThe internship listing is eight years old, but the attacker's mindset has since become a kind of doctrine for the NSA's data spies. And the intelligence service isn't just trying to achieve mass surveillance of Internet communication, either. The digital spies of the Five Eyes alliance -- comprised of the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- want more.\n<strong>The Birth of D Weapons </strong>\nAccording to top secret documents from the archive of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden seen exclusively by SPIEGEL, they are planning for wars of the future in which the Internet will play a critical role, with the aim of being able to use the net to paralyze computer networks and, by doing so, potentially all the infrastructure they control, including power and water supplies, factories, airports or the flow of money.\nDuring the 20th century, scientists developed so-called ABC weapons -- atomic, biological and chemical. It took decades before their deployment could be regulated and, at least partly, outlawed. New digital weapons have now been developed for the war on the Internet. But there are almost no international conventions or supervisory authorities for these D weapons, and the only law that applies is the survival of the fittest.\nCanadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan foresaw these developments decades ago. In 1970, he wrote, \"World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation.\" That's precisely the reality that spies are preparing for today.\nThe US Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force have already established their own cyber forces, but it is the NSA, also officially a military agency, that is taking the lead. It's no coincidence that the director of the NSA also serves as the head of the US Cyber Command. The country's leading data spy, Admiral Michael Rogers, is also its chief cyber warrior and his close to 40,000 employees are responsible for both digital spying and destructive network attacks.\n<strong>Surveillance only 'Phase 0' </strong>\nFrom a military perspective, surveillance of the Internet is merely \"Phase 0\" in the US digital war strategy. Internal NSA documents indicate that it is the prerequisite for everything that follows. They show that the aim of the surveillance is to detect vulnerabilities in enemy systems. Once \"stealthy implants\" have been placed to infiltrate enemy systems, thus allowing \"permanent accesses,\" then Phase Three has been achieved -- a phase headed by the word \"dominate\" in the documents. This enables them to \"control/destroy critical systems &amp; networks at will through pre-positioned accesses (laid in Phase 0).\" Critical infrastructure is considered by the agency to be anything that is important in keeping a society running: energy, communications and transportation. The internal documents state that the ultimate goal is \"real time controlled escalation\".\nOne NSA presentation proclaims that \"the next major conflict will start in cyberspace.\" To that end, the US government is currently undertaking a massive effort to digitally arm itself for network warfare. For the 2013 secret intelligence budget, the NSA projected it would need around $1 billion in order to increase the strength of its computer network attack operations. The budget included an increase of some $32 million for \"unconventional solutions\" alone.\nIn recent years, malware has emerged that experts have attributed to the NSA and its Five Eyes alliance based on a number of indicators. They include programs like Stuxnet, used to attack the Iranian nuclear program. Or Regin, a powerful spyware trojan that created a furor in Germany after it infected the USB stick of a high-ranking staffer to Chancellor Angela Merkel. Agents also used Regin in attacks against the European Commission, the EU's executive, and Belgian telecoms company Belgacom in 2011.<br/>\n<br/>Given that spies can routinely break through just about any security software, virtually all Internet users are at risk of a data attack.\nThe new documents shed some new light on other revelations as well. Although an attack called Quantuminsert has been widely reported by SPIEGEL and others, documentation shows that in reality it has a low success rate and it has likely been replaced by more reliable attacks such as Quantumdirk, which injects malicious content into chat services provided by websites such as Facebook and Yahoo. And computers infected with Straitbizarre can be turned into disposable and non-attributable \"shooter\" nodes. These nodes can then receive messages from the NSA's Quantum network, which is used for \"command and control for very large scale active exploitation and attack.\" The secret agents were also able to breach mobile phones by exploiting a vulnerability in the Safari browser in order to obtain sensitive data and remotely implant malicious code.\nIn this guerilla war over data, little differentiation is made between soldiers and civilians, the Snowden documents show. Any Internet user could suffer damage to his or her data or computer. It also has the potential to create perils in the offline world as well. If, for example, a D weapon like Barnfire were to destroy or \"brick\" the control center of a hospital as a result of a programming error, people who don't even own a mobile phone could be affected.\nIntelligence agencies have adopted \"plausible deniability\" as their guiding principle for Internet operations. To ensure their ability to do so, they seek to make it impossible to trace the author of the attack.\nIt's a stunning approach with which the digital spies deliberately undermine the very foundations of the rule of law around the globe. This approach threatens to transform the Internet into a lawless zone in which superpowers and their secret services operate according to their own whims with very few ways to hold them accountable for their actions.\nAttribution is difficult and requires considerable forensic effort. But in the new documents there are at least a few pointers. Querty, for example, is a keylogger that was part of the Snowden archive. It's a piece of software designed to surreptitiously intercept all keyboard keys pressed by the victim and record them for later inspection. It is an ordinary, indeed rather dated, keylogger. Similar software can already be found in numerous applications, so it doesn't seem to pose any acute danger -- but the sourcecode contained in it does reveal some interesting details. They suggest that this keylogger might be part of the large arsenal of modules that that belong to the Warriorpride program, a kind of universal Esperanto software used by all the Five Eyes partner agencies that at times was even able to break into iPhones, among other capabilities. The documents published by SPIEGEL include sample code from the keylogger to foster further research and enable the creation of appropriate defenses.<br/>\n<br/><strong>'Just a Bunch of Hackers' </strong>\nThe men and women working for the Remote Operations Center (ROC), which uses the codename S321, at the agency's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, work on one of the NSA's most crucial teams, the unit responsible for covert operations. S321 employees are located on the third floor of one of the main buildings on the NSA's campus. In one report from the Snowden archive, an NSA man reminisces about how, when they got started, the ROC people were \"just a bunch of hackers.\" Initially, people worked \"in a more ad hoc manner,\" the report states. Nowadays, however, procedures are \"more systematic\". Even before NSA management massively expanded the ROC group during the summer of 2005, the department's motto was, \"Your data is our data, your equipment is our equipment.\"\nThe agents sit in front of their monitors, working in shifts around the clock. Just how close the NSA has already gotten to its aim of \"global network dominance\" is illustrated particularly well by the work of department S31177, codenamed Transgression.<br/>\n<br/>The department's task is to trace foreign cyber attacks, observe and analyze them and, in the best case scenario, to siphon off the insights of competing intelligence agencies. This form of \"Cyber Counter Intelligence\" counts among the most delicate forms of modern spying.\n<strong>Part 2: How the NSA Reads Over Shoulders of Other Spies</strong><br/>\n<br/>In addition to providing a view of the US's own ability to conduct digital attacks, Snowden's archive also reveals the capabilities of other countries. The Transgression team has access to years of preliminary field work and experience at its disposal, including databases in which malware and network attacks from other countries are cataloged.\nThe Snowden documents show that the NSA and its Five Eyes partners have put numerous network attacks waged by other countries to their own use in recent years. One 2009 document states that the department's remit is to \"discover, understand (and) evaluate\" foreign attacks. Another document reads: \"Steal their tools, tradecraft, targets and take.\"\nIn 2009, an NSA unit took notice of a data breach affecting workers at the US Department of Defense. The department traced an IP address in Asia that functioned as the command center for the attack. By the end of their detective work, the Americans succeeded not only in tracing the attack's point of origin to China, but also in tapping intelligence information from other Chinese attacks -- including data that had been stolen from the United Nations. Afterwards, NSA workers in Fort Meade continued to read over their shoulders as the Chinese secretly collected further internal UN data. \"NSA is able to tap into Chinese SIGINT collection,\" a report on the success in 2011 stated. SIGINT is short for signals intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>The practice of letting other intelligence services do the dirty work and then tapping their results is so successful that the NSA even has a name for it: \"Fourth Party Collection.\" And all countries that aren't part of the Five Eye alliance are considered potential targets for use of this \"non-traditional\" technique -- even Germany.\n<strong>'Difficult To Track, Difficult To Target' </strong>\nThe Snowden documents show that, thanks to fourth party collection, the NSA succeeded in detecting numerous incidents of data spying over the past 10 years, with many attacks originating from China and Russia. It also enabled the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) to track down the IP address of the control server used by China and, from there, to detect the people responsible inside the Peoples' Liberation Army. It wasn't easy, the NSA spies noted. The Chinese had apparently used changing IP addresses, making them \"difficult to track; difficult to target.\" In the end, though, the document states, they succeeded in exploiting a central router.\nThe document suggests that things got more challenging when the NSA sought to turn the tables and go after the attacker. Only after extensive \"wading through uninteresting data\" did they finally succeed in infiltrating the computer of a high-ranking Chinese military official and accessing information regarding targets in the US government and in other governments around the world. They also were able to access sourcecode for Chinese malware.\nBut there have also been successful Chinese operations. The Snowden documents include an internal NSA assessment from a few years ago of the damage caused. The report indicates that the US Defense Department alone registered more than 30,000 known incidents; more than 1,600 computers connected to its network had been hacked. Surprisingly high costs are listed for damage assessment and network repair: more than $100 million.<br/>\n<br/>Among the data on \"sensitive military technologies\" hit in the attack were air refueling schedules, the military logistics planning system, missile navigation systems belonging to the Navy, information about nuclear submarines, missile defense and other top secret defense projects.\nThe desire to know everything isn't, of course, an affliction only suffered by the Chinese, Americans, Russians and British. Years ago, US agents discovered a hacking operation originating in Iran in a monitoring operation that was codenamed Voyeur. A different wave of attacks, known as Snowglobe, appears to have originated in France.\n<strong>Transforming Defenses into Attacks </strong>\nThe search for foreign cyber attacks has long since been largely automated by the NSA and its Five Eyes partners. The Tutelage system can identify incursions and ensure that they do not reach their targets.\nThe examples given in the Snowden documents are not limited to attacks originating in China. The relatively primitive Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) is also mentioned. The name refers to malware used by the protest movement Anonymous to disable target websites. In that instance, one document notes, Tutelage was able to recognize and block the IP addresses being used to conduct the denial of service attack.\nThe NSA is also able to transform its defenses into an attack of its own. The method is described as \"reverse engineer, repurpose software\" and involves botnets, sometimes comprising millions of computers belonging to normal users onto which software has been covertly installed. They can thus be controlled remotely as part of a \"zombie army\" to paralyze companies or to extort them. If the infected hosts appear to be within the United States, the relevant information will be forwarded to the FBI Office of Victim Assistance. However, a host infected with an exploitable bot could be hijacked through a Quantumbot attack and redirected to the NSA. This program is identified in NSA documents as Defiantwarrior and it is said to provide advantages such as \"pervasive network analysis vantage points\" and \"throw-away non-attributable CNA (eds: computer network attack) nodes\". This system leaves people's computers vulnerable and covertly uses them for network operations that might be traced back to an innocent victim. Instead of providing protection to private Internet users, Quantumbot uses them as human shields in order to disguise its own attacks.\nNSA specialists at the Remote Operations Center (ROC) have an entire palette of digital skeleton keys and crowbars enabling access to even the best protected computer networks. They give their tools aggressive-sounding names, as though they were operating an app-store for cyber criminals: The implant tool \"Hammerchant\" allows the recording of Internet-based phone calls (VoIP). Foxacid allows agents to continually add functions to small malware programs even after they have been installed in target computers. The project's logo is a fox that screams as it is dissolved in acid. The NSA has declined to comment on operational details but insists that it has not violated the law.<br/>\n<br/>But as well developed as the weapons of digital war may be, there is a paradox lurking when it comes to breaking into and spying on third party networks: How can intelligence services be sure that they won't become victims of their own methods and be infiltrated by private hackers, criminals or other intelligence services, for example?\nTo control their malware, the Remote Operation Center operatives remain connected to them via their own shadow network, through which highly sensitive telephone recordings, malware programs and passwords travel.\nThe incentive to break into this network is enormous. Any collection of VPN keys, passwords and backdoors is obviously of very high value. Those who possess such passwords and keys could theoretically pillage bank accounts, thwart military deployments, clone fighter jets and shut down power plants. It means nothing less than \"global network dominance\".\nBut the intelligence world is a schizophrenic one. The NSA's job is to defend the Internet while at the same time exploiting its security holes. It is both cop and robber, consistent with the motto adhered to by spies everywhere: \"Reveal their secrets, protect our own.\"\nAs a result, some hacked servers are like a bus during rush hour, with people constantly coming and going. The difference, though, is that the server's owner has no idea anyone is there. And the presumed authorities stand aside and do nothing.\n<strong>'Unwitting Data Mules' </strong>\nIt's absurd: As they are busy spying, the spies are spied on by other spies. In response, they routinely seek to cover their tracks or to lay fake ones instead. In technical terms, the ROC lays false tracks as follows: After third-party computers are infiltrated, the process of exfiltration can begin -- the act of exporting the data that has been gleaned. But the loot isn't delivered directly to ROC's IP address. Rather, it is routed to a so-called Scapegoat Target. That means that stolen information could end up on someone else's servers, making it look as though they were the perpetrators.\nBefore the data ends up at the Scapegoat Target, of course, the NSA intercepts and copies it using its mass surveillance infrastructure and sends it on to the ROC. But such cover-up tactics increase the risk of a controlled or uncontrolled escalation between the agencies involved.\nIt's not just computers, of course, that can be systematically broken into, spied on or misused as part of a botnet. Mobile phones can also be used to steal information from the owner's employer. The unwitting victim, whose phone has been infected with a spy program, smuggles the information out of the office. The information is then retrieved remotely as the victim heads home after work. Digital spies have even adopted drug-dealer slang in referring to these unsuspecting accomplices. They are called \"unwitting data mules.\"\nNSA agents aren't concerned about being caught. That's partly because they work for such a powerful agency, but also because they don't leave behind any evidence that would hold up in court. And if there is no evidence of wrongdoing, there can be no legal penalty, no parliamentary control of intelligence agencies and no international agreement. Thus far, very little is known about the risks and side-effects inherent in these new D weapons and there is almost no government regulation.<br/>\n<br/>Edward Snowden has revealed how intelligence agencies around the world, led by the NSA, are doing their best to ensure a legal vacuum in the Internet. In a recent interview with the US public broadcaster PBS, the whistleblower voiced his concerns that \"defense is becoming less of a priority than offense.\"<br/>\nSnowden finds that concerning. \"What we need to do,\" he said, \"is we need to create new international standards of behavior.\"\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/overseas-war/2015/image-800193-galleryV9-pzti.jpg\" style=\"width: 850px; height: 637px;\"/><br/>\n<br/>The National Security Agency intelligence service isn't just trying to achieve mass surveillance of Internet communication.

They come as senior intelligence officials testify to the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday, releasing classified documents in response to the Guardian's earlier stories on bulk collection of phone records and Fisa surveillance court oversight. [1]\nThe files shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by the Guardian on June 10. [2]\n\"I, sitting at my desk,\" said Snowden, could \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email\".\nUS officials vehemently denied this specific claim. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee, said of Snowden's assertion: \"He's lying. It's impossible for him to do what he was saying he could do.\"\nBut training materials for XKeyscore detail how analysts can use it and other systems to mine enormous agency databases by filling in a simple on-screen form giving only a broad justification for the search. The request is not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel before it is processed.\nXKeyscore, the documents boast, is the NSA's \"widest reaching\" system developing intelligence from computer networks -- what the agency calls Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). One presentation claims the program covers \"nearly everything a typical user does on the internet\", including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata.\nAnalysts can also use XKeyscore and other NSA systems to obtain ongoing \"real-time\" interception of an individual's internet activity.\nUnder US law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant only if the target of their surveillance is a 'US person', though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. But XKeyscore provides the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst.\nOne training slide illustrates the digital activity constantly being collected by XKeyscore and the analyst's ability to query the databases at any time.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"347\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS1-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nThe purpose of XKeyscore is to allow analysts to search the metadata as well as the content of emails and other internet activity, such as browser history, even when there is no known email account (a \"selector\" in NSA parlance) associated with the individual being targeted.\nAnalysts can also search by name, telephone number, IP address, keywords, the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used.\nOne document notes that this is because \"strong selection [search by email address] itself gives us only a very limited capability\" because \"a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous.\"\nThe NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore.\nAnalysts are warned that searching the full database for content will yield too many results to sift through. Instead they are advised to use the metadata also stored in the databases to narrow down what to review.\nA slide entitled \"plug-ins\" in a December 2012 document describes the various fields of information that can be searched. It includes \"every email address seen in a session by both username and domain\", \"every phone number seen in a session (eg address book entries or signature block)\" and user activity -- \"the webmail and chat activity to include username, buddylist, machine specific cookies etc\".\n<strong>Email monitoring</strong><br/>\nIn a second Guardian interview in June, Snowden elaborated on his statement about being able to read any individual's email if he had their email address. He said the claim was based in part on the email search capabilities of XKeyscore, which Snowden says he was authorized to use while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA.\nOne top-secret document describes how the program \"searches within bodies of emails, webpages and documents\", including the \"To, From, CC, BCC lines\" and the 'Contact Us' pages on websites\".\nTo search for emails, an analyst using XKS enters the individual's email address into a simple online search form, along with the \"justification\" for the search and the time period for which the emails are sought.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS2-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS3edit2-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nThe analyst then selects which of those returned emails they want to read by opening them in NSA reading software.\nThe system is similar to the way in which NSA analysts generally can intercept the communications of anyone they select, including, as one NSA document put it, \"communications that transit the United States and communications that terminate in the United States\".\nOne document, a top secret 2010 guide describing the training received by NSA analysts for general surveillance under the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008, explains that analysts can begin surveillance on anyone by clicking a few simple pull-down menus designed to provide both legal and targeting justifications. Once options on the pull-down menus are selected, their target is marked for electronic surveillance and the analyst is able to review the content of their communications:\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"353\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS4-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<strong>Chats, browsing history and other internet activity</strong><br/>\nBeyond emails, the XKeyscore system allows analysts to monitor a virtually unlimited array of other internet activities, including those within social media.\nAn NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"333\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS55edit-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nAn analyst can monitor such Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS6-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>Analysts can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"329\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS7-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>As one slide indicates, the ability to search HTTP activity by keyword permits the analyst access to what the NSA calls \"nearly everything a typical user does on the internet\".<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"324\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS8-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>The XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"258\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS9-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>The quantity of communications accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is staggeringly large. One NSA report from 2007 estimated that there were 850bn \"call events\" collected and stored in the NSA databases, and close to 150bn internet records. Each day, the document says, 1-2bn records were added.\nWilliam Binney, a former NSA mathematician, said last year that the agency had \"assembled on the order of 20tn transactions about US citizens with other US citizens\", an estimate, he said, that \"only was involving phone calls and emails\". A 2010 Washington Post article reported that \"every day, collection systems at the [NSA] intercept and store 1.7bn emails, phone calls and other type of communications.\"\nThe XKeyscore system is continuously collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content remains on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains: \"At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.\"\nTo solve this problem, the NSA has created a multi-tiered system that allows analysts to store \"interesting\" content in other databases, such as one named Pinwale which can store material for up to five years. \nIt is the databases of XKeyscore, one document shows, that now contain the greatest amount of communications data collected by the NSA.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"325\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS10-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nIn 2012, there were at least 41 billion total records collected and stored in XKeyscore for a single 30-day period.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"187\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS11-002.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"220\"/><br/>\n<br/><strong>Legal v technical restrictions</strong><br/>\nWhile the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of US persons, NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA's foreign targets.\nThe ACLU's deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, told the Guardian last month that national security officials expressly said that a primary purpose of the new law was to enable them to collect large amounts of Americans' communications without individualized warrants.\n\"The government doesn't need to 'target' Americans in order to collect huge volumes of their communications,\" said Jaffer. \"The government inevitably sweeps up the communications of many Americans\" when targeting foreign nationals for surveillance.\nAn example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and New York.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"257\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS12-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nIn recent years, the NSA has attempted to segregate exclusively domestic US communications in separate databases. But even NSA documents acknowledge that such efforts are imperfect, as even purely domestic communications can travel on foreign systems, and NSA tools are sometimes unable to identify the national origins of communications.\nMoreover, all communications between Americans and someone on foreign soil are included in the same databases as foreign-to-foreign communications, making them readily searchable without warrants.\nSome searches conducted by NSA analysts are periodically reviewed by their supervisors within the NSA. \"It's very rare to be questioned on our searches,\" Snowden told the Guardian in June, \"and even when we are, it's usually along the lines of: 'let's bulk up the justification'.\"\nIn a letter this week to senator Ron Wyden, director of national intelligence James Clapper acknowledged that NSA analysts have exceeded even legal limits as interpreted by the NSA in domestic surveillance.\nAcknowledging what he called \"a number of compliance problems\", Clapper attributed them to \"human error\" or \"highly sophisticated technology issues\" rather than \"bad faith\".\nHowever, Wyden said on the Senate floor on Tuesday: \"These violations are more serious than those stated by the intelligence community, and are troubling.\"\nIn a statement to the Guardian, the NSA said: \"NSA's activities are focused and specifically deployed against -- and only against -- legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests.\n\"XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system.\n\"Allegations of widespread, unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks ... In addition, there are multiple technical, manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring.\"\n\"Every search by an NSA analyst is fully auditable, to ensure that they are proper and within the law.\n\"These types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully -- to defend the nation and to protect US and allied troops abroad.\"\n[1] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files</a><br/>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video\" title=\"\">http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video</a>\n</div>",

Around the world, when a person gets online to do anything -- write an email, post to a social network, browse the web or play a video game -- there's a decent chance that the Internet traffic her device sends and receives is getting collected and processed by one of XKEYSCORE's hundreds of servers scattered across the globe.\nIn order to make sense of such a massive and steady flow of information, analysts working for the National Security Agency, as well as partner spy agencies, have written thousands of snippets of code to detect different types of traffic and extract useful information from each type, according to documents dating up to 2013. For example, the system automatically detects if a given piece of traffic is an email. If it is, the system tags if it's from Yahoo or Gmail, if it contains an airline itinerary, if it's encrypted with PGP, or if the sender's language is set to Arabic, along with myriad other details.\nThis global Internet surveillance network is powered by a somewhat clunky piece of software running on clusters of Linux servers. Analysts access XKEYSCORE's web interface to search its wealth of private information, similar to how ordinary people can search Google for public information.\nBased on documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, The Intercept is shedding light on the inner workings of XKEYSCORE, one of the most extensive programs of mass surveillance in human history.\n<strong>How XKEYSCORE works under the hood</strong>\nIt is tempting to assume that expensive, proprietary operating systems and software must power XKEYSCORE, but it actually relies on an entirely open source stack. In fact, according to an analysis of an XKEYSCORE manual for new systems administrators from the end of 2012, the system may have design deficiencies that could leave it vulnerable to attack by an intelligence agency insider.\nXKEYSCORE is a piece of Linux software that is typically deployed on Red Hat servers. It uses the Apache web server and stores collected data in MySQL databases. File systems in a cluster are handled by the NFS distributed file system and the autofs service, and scheduled tasks are handled by the cron scheduling service. Systems administrators who maintain XKEYSCORE servers use SSH to connect to them, and they use tools such as rsync and vim, as well as a comprehensive command-line tool, to manage the software.\nJohn Adams, former security lead and senior operations engineer for Twitter, says that one of the most interesting things about XKEYSCORE's architecture is \"that they were able to achieve so much success with such a poorly designed system. Data ingest, day-to-day operations, and searching is all poorly designed. There are many open source offerings that would function far better than this design with very little work. Their operations team must be extremely unhappy.\"\nAnalysts connect to XKEYSCORE over HTTPS using standard web browsers such as Firefox. Internet Explorer is not supported. Analysts can log into the system with either a user ID and password or by using public key authentication.\nAs of 2009, XKEYSCORE servers were located at more than 100 field sites all over the world. Each field site consists of a cluster of servers; the exact number differs depending on how much information is being collected at that site. Sites with relatively low traffic can get by with fewer servers, but sites that spy on larger amounts of traffic require more servers to filter and parse it all. XKEYSCORE has been engineered to scale in both processing power and storage by adding more servers to a cluster. According to a 2009 document, some field sites receive over 20 terrabytes of data per day. This is the equivalent of 5.7 million songs, or over 13 thousand full-length films.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-map-125-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\n<em>This map from a 2009 top-secret presentation does not show all of XKEYSCORE's field sites.</em>\nWhen data is collected at an XKEYSCORE field site, it is processed locally and ultimately stored in MySQL databases at that site. XKEYSCORE supports a federated query system, which means that an analyst can conduct a single query from the central XKEYSCORE website, and it will communicate over the Internet to all of the field sites, running the query everywhere at once.\nThere might be security issues with the XKEYSCORE system itself as well. As hard as software developers may try, it's nearly impossible to write bug-free source code. To compensate for this, developers often rely on multiple layers of security; if attackers can get through one layer, they may still be thwarted by other layers. XKEYSCORE appears to do a bad job of this.\nWhen systems administrators log into XKEYSCORE servers to configure them, they appear to use a shared account, under the name \"oper.\" Adams notes, \"That means that changes made by an administrator cannot be logged.\" If one administrator does something malicious on an XKEYSCORE server using the \"oper\" user, it's possible that the digital trail of what was done wouldn't lead back to the administrator, since multiple operators use the account.\nThere appears to be another way an ill-intentioned systems administrator may be able to cover their tracks. Analysts wishing to query XKEYSCORE sign in via a web browser, and their searches are logged. This creates an audit trail, on which the system relies to assure that users aren't doing overly broad searches that would pull up U.S. citizens' web traffic. Systems administrators, however, are able to run MySQL queries. The documents indicate that administrators have the ability to directly query the MySQL databases, where the collected data is stored, apparently bypassing the audit trail.\n<strong>AppIDs, fingerprints and microplugins</strong>\nCollecting massive amounts of raw data is not very useful unless it is collated and organized in a way that can be searched. To deal with this problem, XKEYSCORE extracts and tags metadata and content from the raw data so that analysts can easily search it.\nThis is done by using dictionaries of rules called appIDs, fingerprints and microplugins that are written in a custom programming language called GENESIS. Each of these can be identified by a unique name that resembles a directory tree, such as \"mail/webmail/gmail,\" \"chat/yahoo,\" or \"botnet/blackenergybot/command/flood.\"\nOne document detailing XKEYSCORE appIDs and fingerprints lists several revealing examples. Windows Update requests appear to fall under the \"update_service/windows\" appID, and normal web requests fall under the \"http/get\" appID. XKEYSCORE can automatically detect Airblue travel itineraries with the \"travel/airblue\" fingerprint, and iPhone web browser traffic with the \"browser/cellphone/iphone\" fingerprint.\nPGP-encrypted messages are detected with the \"encryption/pgp/message\" fingerprint, and messages encrypted with Mojahedeen Secrets 2 (a type of encryption popular among supporters of al Qaeda) are detected with the \"encryption/mojaheden2\" fingerprint.\nWhen new traffic flows into an XKEYSCORE cluster, the system tests the intercepted data against each of these rules and stores whether the traffic matches the pattern. A slideshow presentation from 2010 says that XKEYSCORE contains almost 10,000 appIDs and fingerprints.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-app-for-that-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nAppIDs are used to identify the protocol of traffic being intercepted, while fingerprints detect a specific type of content. Each intercepted stream of traffic gets assigned up to one appID and any number of fingerprints. You can think of appIDs as categories and fingerprints as tags.\nIf multiple appIDs match a single stream of traffic, the appID with the lowest \"level\" is selected (appIDs with lower levels are more specific than appIDs with higher levels). For example, when XKEYSCORE is assessing a file attachment from Yahoo mail, all of the appIDs in the following slide will apply, however only \"mail/webmail/yahoo/attachment\" will be associated with this stream of traffic.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-appids-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nTo tie it all together, when an Arabic speaker logs into a Yahoo email address, XKEYSCORE will store \"mail/yahoo/login\" as the associated appID. This stream of traffic will match the \"mail/arabic\" fingerprint (denoting language settings), as well as the \"mail/yahoo/ymbm\" fingerprint (which detects Yahoo browser cookies).\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-appids-fingerprints-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nSometimes the GENESIS programming language, which largely relies on Boolean logic, regular expressions and a set of simple functions, isn't powerful enough to do the complex pattern-matching required to detect certain types of traffic. In these cases, as one slide puts it, \"Power users can drop in to C++ to express themselves.\" AppIDs or fingerprints that are written in C++ are called microplugins.\nHere's an example of a microplugin fingerprint for \"botnet/conficker_p2p_udp_data,\" which is tricky botnet traffic that can't be identified without complicated logic. A botnet is a collection of hacked computers, sometimes millions of them, that are controlled from a single point.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-conficker-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nHere's another microplugin that uses C++ to inspect intercepted Facebook chat messages and pull out details like the associated email address and body of the chat message.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-facebook-chat-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nOne document from 2009 describes in detail four generations of appIDs and fingerprints, which begin with only the ability to scan intercepted traffic for keywords, and end with the ability to write complex microplugins that can be deployed to field sites around the world in hours.\nIf XKEYSCORE development has continued at a similar pace over the last six years, it's likely considerably more powerful today.\nEmail the authors: micah.lee@theintercept.com, glenn.greenwald@theintercept.com, morgan@firstlook.org\n<em>Documents published with this

Today, The Intercept is publishing 48 top-secret and other classified documents about XKEYSCORE dated up to 2013, which shed new light on the breadth, depth and functionality of this critical spy system -- one of the largest releases yet of documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\nThe NSA's XKEYSCORE program, first revealed [1] by The Guardian, sweeps up countless people's Internet searches, emails, documents, usernames and passwords, and other private communications. XKEYSCORE is fed a constant flow of Internet traffic from fiber optic cables [2] that make up the backbone of the world's communication network, among other sources, for processing. As of 2008, the surveillance system boasted approximately 150 field sites in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, Nigeria, Somalia, Pakistan, Japan, Australia, as well as many other countries, consisting of over 700 servers.\nThese servers store \"full-take data\" at the collection sites -- meaning that they captured all of the traffic collected -- and, as of 2009, stored content for 3 to 5 days and metadata for 30 to 45 days. NSA documents indicate that tens of billions of records are stored in its database. \"It is a fully distributed processing and query system that runs on machines around the world,\" an NSA briefing on XKEYSCORE says. \"At field sites, XKEYSCORE can run on multiple computers that gives it the ability to scale in both processing power and storage.\"\nXKEYSCORE also collects and processes Internet traffic from Americans, though NSA analysts are taught to avoid querying the system in ways that might result in spying on U.S. data. Experts and privacy activists, however, have long doubted that such exclusions are effective in preventing large amounts of American data from being swept up. One document The Intercept is publishing today suggests that FISA warrants have authorized \"full-take\" collection of traffic from at least some U.S. web forums.\nThe system is not limited to collecting web traffic. The 2013 document, \"VoIP Configuration and Forwarding Read Me,\" details how to forward VoIP data from XKEYSCORE into NUCLEON, NSA's repository for voice intercepts, facsimile, video and \"pre-released transcription.\" At the time, it supported more than 8,000 users globally and was made up of 75 servers absorbing 700,000 voice, fax, video and tag files per day.\nThe reach and potency of XKEYSCORE as a surveillance instrument is astonishing. The Guardian report noted that NSA itself refers to the program as its \"widest reaching\" system. In February of this year, The Intercept reported [3] that NSA and GCHQ hacked into the internal network of Gemalto, the world's largest provider of cell phone SIM cards, in order to steal millions of encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cell phone communication. XKEYSCORE played a vital role in the spies' hacking by providing government hackers access to the email accounts of Gemalto employees.\nNumerous key NSA partners, including Canada, New Zealand and the U.K., have access to the mass surveillance databases of XKEYSCORE. In March, the New Zealand Herald, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed [4] that the New Zealand government used XKEYSCORE to spy on candidates for the position of World Trade Organization director general and also members of the Solomon Islands government. [5]\nThese newly published documents demonstrate that collected communications not only include emails, chats and web-browsing traffic, but also pictures, documents, voice calls, webcam photos, web searches, advertising analytics traffic, social media traffic, botnet traffic, logged keystrokes, computer network exploitation (CNE) targeting, intercepted username and password pairs, file uploads to online services, Skype sessions and more.\n<strong>Bulk collection and population surveillance</strong>\nXKEYSCORE allows for incredibly broad surveillance of people based on perceived patterns of suspicious behavior. It is possible, for instance, to query the system to show the activities of people based on their location, nationality and websites visited. For instance, one slide displays the search \"germansinpakistn,\" showing an analyst querying XKEYSCORE for all individuals in Pakistan visiting specific German language message boards. [6]\nAs sites like Twitter and Facebook become increasingly significant in the world's day-to-day communications (a Pew study shows [7] that 71 percent of online adults in the U.S. use Facebook), they become a critical source of surveillance data. Traffic from popular social media sites is described as \"a great starting point\" for tracking individuals, according to an XKEYSCORE presentation [8] titled \"Tracking Targets on Online Social Networks.\"\nWhen intelligence agencies collect massive amounts of Internet traffic all over the world, they face the challenge of making sense of that data. The vast quantities collected make it difficult to connect the stored traffic to specific individuals.\nInternet companies have also encountered this problem and have solved it by tracking their users with identifiers that are unique to each individual, often in the form of browser cookies. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in visitors' browsers. They are used for a variety of purposes, including authenticating users (cookies make it possible to log in to websites), storing preferences, and uniquely tracking individuals even if they're using the same IP address as many other people. Websites also embed code used by third-party services to collect analytics or host ads, which also use cookies to track users. According to one slide, [9] \"Almost all websites have cookies enabled.\"\nThe NSA's ability to piggyback off of private companies' tracking of their own users is a vital instrument that allows the agency to trace the data it collects to individual users. It makes no difference if visitors switch to public Wi-Fi networks or connect to VPNs to change their IP addresses: the tracking cookie will follow them around as long as they are using the same web browser and fail to clear their cookies.\nApps that run on tablets and smartphones also use analytics services that uniquely track users. Almost every time a user sees an advertisement (in an app or in a web browser), the ad network is tracking users in the same way. A secret GCHQ and CSE program called BADASS, [10] which is similar to XKEYSCORE but with a much narrower scope, mines as much valuable information from leaky smartphone apps as possible, including unique tracking identifiers that app developers use to track their own users. In May of this year, CBC, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed [11] that XKEYSCORE was used to track smartphone connections to the app marketplaces run by Samsung and Google. Surveillance agency analysts also use other types of traffic data that gets scooped into XKEYSCORE to track people, such as Windows crash reports. [12]\nIn a statement to The Intercept, the NSA reiterated its position that such sweeping surveillance capabilities are needed to fight the War on Terror:\n\"The U.S. Government calls on its intelligence agencies to protect the United States, its citizens, and its allies from a wide array of serious threats. These threats include terrorist plots from al-Qaeda, ISIL, and others; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; foreign aggression against the United States and our allies; and international criminal organizations.\"\nIndeed, one of the specific examples of XKEYSCORE applications given in the documents is spying on Shaykh Atiyatallah, an al Qaeda senior leader and Osama bin Laden confidant. A few years before his death, Atiyatallah did what many people have often done: He googled himself. He searched his various aliases, an associate and the name of his book. As he did so, all of that information was captured by XKEYSCORE.\nXKEYSCORE has, however, also been used to spy on non-terrorist targets. The April 18, 2013 issue of the internal NSA publication Special Source Operations Weekly boasts [13] that analysts were successful in using XKEYSCORE to obtain U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's talking points prior to a meeting with President Obama.\n<strong>XKEYSCORE for hacking: easily collecting user names, passwords and much more</strong>\nXKEYSCORE plays a central role in how the U.S. government and its surveillance allies hack computer networks around the world. One top-secret 2009 NSA document describes how the system is used by the NSA to gather information for the Office of Tailored Access Operations, an NSA division responsible for Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) -- i.e., targeted hacking.\nParticularly in 2009, the hacking tactics enabled by XKEYSCORE would have yielded significant returns as use of encryption was less widespread than today. Jonathan Brossard, a security researcher and the CEO of Toucan Systems, told The Intercept: \"Anyone could be trained to do this in less than one day: they simply enter the name of the server they want to hack into XKEYSCORE, type enter, and are presented login and password pairs to connect to this machine. Done. Finito.\" Previous reporting [14] by The Intercept revealed that systems administrators are a popular target of the NSA. \"Who better to target than the person that already has the 'keys to the kingdom?'\" read a 2012 post on an internal NSA discussion board.\nThis system enables analysts to access web mail servers with remarkable ease. [15]\nThe same methods are used to steal the credentials -- user names and passwords -- of individual users of message boards. [16]\nHacker forums [17] are also monitored for people selling or using exploits and other hacking tools. While the NSA is clearly monitoring to understand the capabilities developed by its adversaries, it is also monitoring locations where such capabilities can be purchased.\nOther information gained via XKEYSCORE facilitates the remote exploitation of target computers. By extracting browser fingerprint and operating system versions from Internet traffic, the system allows analysts to quickly assess the exploitability of a target. [18] Brossard, the security researcher, said that \"NSA has built an impressively complete set of automated hacking tools for their analysts to use.\"\nGiven the breadth of information collected by XKEYSCORE, accessing and exploiting a target's online activity is a matter of a few mouse clicks. Brossard explains: \"The amount of work an analyst has to perform to actually break into remote computers over the Internet seems ridiculously reduced -- we are talking minutes, if not seconds. Simple. As easy as typing a few words in Google.\"\nThese facts bolster one of Snowden's most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by The Guardian [19] on June 9, 2013. \"I, sitting at my desk,\" said Snowden, could \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge to even the president, if I had a personal email.\"\nIndeed, training documents for XKEYSCORE repeatedly highlight how user-friendly the program is: with just a few clicks, any analyst with access to it can conduct sweeping searches simply by entering a person's email address, telephone number, name or other identifying data. There is no indication in the documents reviewed that prior approval is needed for specific searches.\nIn addition to login credentials and other target intelligence, XKEYSCORE collects router configuration information, [20] which it shares with Tailored Access Operations. The office is able to exploit routers and then feed the traffic traveling through those routers into their collection infrastructure. This allows the NSA to spy on traffic from otherwise out-of-reach networks. XKEYSCORE documents reference router configurations, and a document previously published by Der Spiegel [21] shows that \"active implants\" can be used to \"cop[y] traffic and direc[t]\" it past a passive collector.\n<strong>XKEYSCORE for counterintelligence</strong>\nBeyond enabling the collection, categorization, and querying of metadata and content, XKEYSCORE has also been used to monitor the surveillance and hacking actions of foreign nation states and to gather the fruits of their hacking. The Intercept previously reported [22] that NSA and its allies spy on hackers in order to collect what they collect.\nOnce the hacking tools and techniques of a foreign entity (for instance, South Korea) [23] are identified, analysts can then extract the country's espionage targets from XKEYSCORE, and gather information that the foreign power has managed to steal.\nMonitoring of foreign state hackers could allow the NSA to gather techniques and tools used by foreign actors, including knowledge of zero-day exploits--software bugs that allow attackers to hack into systems, and that not even the software vendor knows about--and implants. Additionally, by monitoring vulnerability reports sent to vendors such as Kaspersky, [24] the agency could learn when exploits they were actively using need to be retired because they've been discovered by a third party.\n<strong>Seizure v. searching: oversight, audit trail and the Fourth Amendment</strong>\nBy the nature of how it sweeps up information, XKEYSCORE gathers communications of Americans, despite the Fourth Amendment protection against \"unreasonable search and seizure\" -- including searching data without a warrant. The NSA says it does not target U.S. citizens' communications without a warrant, but acknowledges that it \"incidentally\" collects and reads some of it without one, minimizing the information that is retained or shared.<br/>\nBut that interpretation of the law is dubious at best.\nXKEYSCORE training documents say that the \"burden is on user/auditor to comply with USSID-18 or other rules,\" apparently including the British Human Rights Act (HRA), which protects the rights of U.K. citizens. U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 (USSID 18) is the American directive that governs \"U.S. person minimization.\"\nKurt Opsahl, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's general counsel, describes USSID 18 as \"an attempt by the intelligence community to comply with the Fourth Amendment. But it doesn't come from a court, it comes from the executive.\"\nIf, for instance, an analyst searched XKEYSCORE for all iPhone users, this query would violate USSID 18 [25] due to the inevitable American iPhone users that would be grabbed without a warrant, as the NSA's own training materials make clear.\nOpsahl believes that analysts are not prevented by technical means from making queries that violate USSID 18. \"The document discusses whether auditors will be happy or unhappy. This indicates that compliance will be achieved by after-the-fact auditing, not by preventing the search.\"\nScreenshots of the XKEYSCORE web-based user interface included in slides show that analysts see a prominent warning message: \"This system is audited for USSID 18 and Human Rights Act compliance.\" When analysts log in to the system, they see a more detailed message warning that \"an audit trail has been established and will be searched\" in response to HRA complaints, and as part of the USSID 18 and USSID 9 audit process.\nBecause the XKEYSCORE system does not appear to prevent analysts from making queries that would be in violation of these rules, Opsahl concludes that \"there's a tremendous amount of power being placed in the hands of analysts.\" And while those analysts may be subject to audits, \"at least in the short term they can still obtain information that they shouldn't have.\"\nDuring a symposium [26] in January 2015 hosted at Harvard University, Edward Snowden, who spoke via video call, said that NSA analysts are \"completely free from any meaningful oversight.\" Speaking about the people who audit NSA systems like XKEYSCORE for USSID 18 compliance, he said, \"The majority of the people who are doing the auditing are the friends of the analysts. They work in the same office. They're not full-time auditors, they're guys who have other duties assigned. There are a few traveling auditors who go around and look at the things that are out there, but really it's not robust.\"\nIn a statement to The Intercept, the NSA said:\n\"The National Security Agency's foreign intelligence operations are 1) authorized by law; 2) subject to multiple layers of stringent internal and external oversight; and 3) conducted in a manner that is designed to protect privacy and civil liberties. As provided for by Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28), all persons, regardless of their nationality, have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information. NSA goes to great lengths to narrowly tailor and focus its signals intelligence operations on the collection of communications that are most likely to contain foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information.\"\n<em>Coming next: A Look Under the Hood of XKEYSCORE</em>\n<em>Documents published with this article:</em>\n* <a

They come as senior intelligence officials testify to the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday, releasing classified documents in response to the Guardian's earlier stories on bulk collection of phone records and Fisa surveillance court oversight. [1]\nThe files shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by the Guardian on June 10. [2]\n\"I, sitting at my desk,\" said Snowden, could \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email\".\nUS officials vehemently denied this specific claim. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee, said of Snowden's assertion: \"He's lying. It's impossible for him to do what he was saying he could do.\"\nBut training materials for XKeyscore detail how analysts can use it and other systems to mine enormous agency databases by filling in a simple on-screen form giving only a broad justification for the search. The request is not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel before it is processed.\nXKeyscore, the documents boast, is the NSA's \"widest reaching\" system developing intelligence from computer networks -- what the agency calls Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). One presentation claims the program covers \"nearly everything a typical user does on the internet\", including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata.\nAnalysts can also use XKeyscore and other NSA systems to obtain ongoing \"real-time\" interception of an individual's internet activity.\nUnder US law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant only if the target of their surveillance is a 'US person', though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. But XKeyscore provides the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst.\nOne training slide illustrates the digital activity constantly being collected by XKeyscore and the analyst's ability to query the databases at any time.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"347\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS1-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nThe purpose of XKeyscore is to allow analysts to search the metadata as well as the content of emails and other internet activity, such as browser history, even when there is no known email account (a \"selector\" in NSA parlance) associated with the individual being targeted.\nAnalysts can also search by name, telephone number, IP address, keywords, the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used.\nOne document notes that this is because \"strong selection [search by email address] itself gives us only a very limited capability\" because \"a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous.\"\nThe NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore.\nAnalysts are warned that searching the full database for content will yield too many results to sift through. Instead they are advised to use the metadata also stored in the databases to narrow down what to review.\nA slide entitled \"plug-ins\" in a December 2012 document describes the various fields of information that can be searched. It includes \"every email address seen in a session by both username and domain\", \"every phone number seen in a session (eg address book entries or signature block)\" and user activity -- \"the webmail and chat activity to include username, buddylist, machine specific cookies etc\".\n<strong>Email monitoring</strong><br/>\nIn a second Guardian interview in June, Snowden elaborated on his statement about being able to read any individual's email if he had their email address. He said the claim was based in part on the email search capabilities of XKeyscore, which Snowden says he was authorized to use while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA.\nOne top-secret document describes how the program \"searches within bodies of emails, webpages and documents\", including the \"To, From, CC, BCC lines\" and the 'Contact Us' pages on websites\".\nTo search for emails, an analyst using XKS enters the individual's email address into a simple online search form, along with the \"justification\" for the search and the time period for which the emails are sought.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS2-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS3edit2-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nThe analyst then selects which of those returned emails they want to read by opening them in NSA reading software.\nThe system is similar to the way in which NSA analysts generally can intercept the communications of anyone they select, including, as one NSA document put it, \"communications that transit the United States and communications that terminate in the United States\".\nOne document, a top secret 2010 guide describing the training received by NSA analysts for general surveillance under the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008, explains that analysts can begin surveillance on anyone by clicking a few simple pull-down menus designed to provide both legal and targeting justifications. Once options on the pull-down menus are selected, their target is marked for electronic surveillance and the analyst is able to review the content of their communications:\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"353\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS4-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<strong>Chats, browsing history and other internet activity</strong><br/>\nBeyond emails, the XKeyscore system allows analysts to monitor a virtually unlimited array of other internet activities, including those within social media.\nAn NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"333\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS55edit-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nAn analyst can monitor such Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS6-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>Analysts can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"329\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS7-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>As one slide indicates, the ability to search HTTP activity by keyword permits the analyst access to what the NSA calls \"nearly everything a typical user does on the internet\".<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"324\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS8-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>The XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"258\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS9-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>The quantity of communications accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is staggeringly large. One NSA report from 2007 estimated that there were 850bn \"call events\" collected and stored in the NSA databases, and close to 150bn internet records. Each day, the document says, 1-2bn records were added.\nWilliam Binney, a former NSA mathematician, said last year that the agency had \"assembled on the order of 20tn transactions about US citizens with other US citizens\", an estimate, he said, that \"only was involving phone calls and emails\". A 2010 Washington Post article reported that \"every day, collection systems at the [NSA] intercept and store 1.7bn emails, phone calls and other type of communications.\"\nThe XKeyscore system is continuously collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content remains on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains: \"At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.\"\nTo solve this problem, the NSA has created a multi-tiered system that allows analysts to store \"interesting\" content in other databases, such as one named Pinwale which can store material for up to five years. \nIt is the databases of XKeyscore, one document shows, that now contain the greatest amount of communications data collected by the NSA.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"325\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS10-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nIn 2012, there were at least 41 billion total records collected and stored in XKeyscore for a single 30-day period.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"187\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS11-002.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"220\"/><br/>\n<br/><strong>Legal v technical restrictions</strong><br/>\nWhile the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of US persons, NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA's foreign targets.\nThe ACLU's deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, told the Guardian last month that national security officials expressly said that a primary purpose of the new law was to enable them to collect large amounts of Americans' communications without individualized warrants.\n\"The government doesn't need to 'target' Americans in order to collect huge volumes of their communications,\" said Jaffer. \"The government inevitably sweeps up the communications of many Americans\" when targeting foreign nationals for surveillance.\nAn example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and New York.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"257\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS12-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nIn recent years, the NSA has attempted to segregate exclusively domestic US communications in separate databases. But even NSA documents acknowledge that such efforts are imperfect, as even purely domestic communications can travel on foreign systems, and NSA tools are sometimes unable to identify the national origins of communications.\nMoreover, all communications between Americans and someone on foreign soil are included in the same databases as foreign-to-foreign communications, making them readily searchable without warrants.\nSome searches conducted by NSA analysts are periodically reviewed by their supervisors within the NSA. \"It's very rare to be questioned on our searches,\" Snowden told the Guardian in June, \"and even when we are, it's usually along the lines of: 'let's bulk up the justification'.\"\nIn a letter this week to senator Ron Wyden, director of national intelligence James Clapper acknowledged that NSA analysts have exceeded even legal limits as interpreted by the NSA in domestic surveillance.\nAcknowledging what he called \"a number of compliance problems\", Clapper attributed them to \"human error\" or \"highly sophisticated technology issues\" rather than \"bad faith\".\nHowever, Wyden said on the Senate floor on Tuesday: \"These violations are more serious than those stated by the intelligence community, and are troubling.\"\nIn a statement to the Guardian, the NSA said: \"NSA's activities are focused and specifically deployed against -- and only against -- legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests.\n\"XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system.\n\"Allegations of widespread, unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks ... In addition, there are multiple technical, manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring.\"\n\"Every search by an NSA analyst is fully auditable, to ensure that they are proper and within the law.\n\"These types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully -- to defend the nation and to protect US and allied troops abroad.\"\n[1] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files</a><br/>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video\" title=\"\">http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video</a>\n</div>",

Today, The Intercept is publishing 48 top-secret and other classified documents about XKEYSCORE dated up to 2013, which shed new light on the breadth, depth and functionality of this critical spy system -- one of the largest releases yet of documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\nThe NSA's XKEYSCORE program, first revealed [1] by The Guardian, sweeps up countless people's Internet searches, emails, documents, usernames and passwords, and other private communications. XKEYSCORE is fed a constant flow of Internet traffic from fiber optic cables [2] that make up the backbone of the world's communication network, among other sources, for processing. As of 2008, the surveillance system boasted approximately 150 field sites in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, Nigeria, Somalia, Pakistan, Japan, Australia, as well as many other countries, consisting of over 700 servers.\nThese servers store \"full-take data\" at the collection sites -- meaning that they captured all of the traffic collected -- and, as of 2009, stored content for 3 to 5 days and metadata for 30 to 45 days. NSA documents indicate that tens of billions of records are stored in its database. \"It is a fully distributed processing and query system that runs on machines around the world,\" an NSA briefing on XKEYSCORE says. \"At field sites, XKEYSCORE can run on multiple computers that gives it the ability to scale in both processing power and storage.\"\nXKEYSCORE also collects and processes Internet traffic from Americans, though NSA analysts are taught to avoid querying the system in ways that might result in spying on U.S. data. Experts and privacy activists, however, have long doubted that such exclusions are effective in preventing large amounts of American data from being swept up. One document The Intercept is publishing today suggests that FISA warrants have authorized \"full-take\" collection of traffic from at least some U.S. web forums.\nThe system is not limited to collecting web traffic. The 2013 document, \"VoIP Configuration and Forwarding Read Me,\" details how to forward VoIP data from XKEYSCORE into NUCLEON, NSA's repository for voice intercepts, facsimile, video and \"pre-released transcription.\" At the time, it supported more than 8,000 users globally and was made up of 75 servers absorbing 700,000 voice, fax, video and tag files per day.\nThe reach and potency of XKEYSCORE as a surveillance instrument is astonishing. The Guardian report noted that NSA itself refers to the program as its \"widest reaching\" system. In February of this year, The Intercept reported [3] that NSA and GCHQ hacked into the internal network of Gemalto, the world's largest provider of cell phone SIM cards, in order to steal millions of encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cell phone communication. XKEYSCORE played a vital role in the spies' hacking by providing government hackers access to the email accounts of Gemalto employees.\nNumerous key NSA partners, including Canada, New Zealand and the U.K., have access to the mass surveillance databases of XKEYSCORE. In March, the New Zealand Herald, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed [4] that the New Zealand government used XKEYSCORE to spy on candidates for the position of World Trade Organization director general and also members of the Solomon Islands government. [5]\nThese newly published documents demonstrate that collected communications not only include emails, chats and web-browsing traffic, but also pictures, documents, voice calls, webcam photos, web searches, advertising analytics traffic, social media traffic, botnet traffic, logged keystrokes, computer network exploitation (CNE) targeting, intercepted username and password pairs, file uploads to online services, Skype sessions and more.\n<strong>Bulk collection and population surveillance</strong>\nXKEYSCORE allows for incredibly broad surveillance of people based on perceived patterns of suspicious behavior. It is possible, for instance, to query the system to show the activities of people based on their location, nationality and websites visited. For instance, one slide displays the search \"germansinpakistn,\" showing an analyst querying XKEYSCORE for all individuals in Pakistan visiting specific German language message boards. [6]\nAs sites like Twitter and Facebook become increasingly significant in the world's day-to-day communications (a Pew study shows [7] that 71 percent of online adults in the U.S. use Facebook), they become a critical source of surveillance data. Traffic from popular social media sites is described as \"a great starting point\" for tracking individuals, according to an XKEYSCORE presentation [8] titled \"Tracking Targets on Online Social Networks.\"\nWhen intelligence agencies collect massive amounts of Internet traffic all over the world, they face the challenge of making sense of that data. The vast quantities collected make it difficult to connect the stored traffic to specific individuals.\nInternet companies have also encountered this problem and have solved it by tracking their users with identifiers that are unique to each individual, often in the form of browser cookies. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in visitors' browsers. They are used for a variety of purposes, including authenticating users (cookies make it possible to log in to websites), storing preferences, and uniquely tracking individuals even if they're using the same IP address as many other people. Websites also embed code used by third-party services to collect analytics or host ads, which also use cookies to track users. According to one slide, [9] \"Almost all websites have cookies enabled.\"\nThe NSA's ability to piggyback off of private companies' tracking of their own users is a vital instrument that allows the agency to trace the data it collects to individual users. It makes no difference if visitors switch to public Wi-Fi networks or connect to VPNs to change their IP addresses: the tracking cookie will follow them around as long as they are using the same web browser and fail to clear their cookies.\nApps that run on tablets and smartphones also use analytics services that uniquely track users. Almost every time a user sees an advertisement (in an app or in a web browser), the ad network is tracking users in the same way. A secret GCHQ and CSE program called BADASS, [10] which is similar to XKEYSCORE but with a much narrower scope, mines as much valuable information from leaky smartphone apps as possible, including unique tracking identifiers that app developers use to track their own users. In May of this year, CBC, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed [11] that XKEYSCORE was used to track smartphone connections to the app marketplaces run by Samsung and Google. Surveillance agency analysts also use other types of traffic data that gets scooped into XKEYSCORE to track people, such as Windows crash reports. [12]\nIn a statement to The Intercept, the NSA reiterated its position that such sweeping surveillance capabilities are needed to fight the War on Terror:\n\"The U.S. Government calls on its intelligence agencies to protect the United States, its citizens, and its allies from a wide array of serious threats. These threats include terrorist plots from al-Qaeda, ISIL, and others; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; foreign aggression against the United States and our allies; and international criminal organizations.\"\nIndeed, one of the specific examples of XKEYSCORE applications given in the documents is spying on Shaykh Atiyatallah, an al Qaeda senior leader and Osama bin Laden confidant. A few years before his death, Atiyatallah did what many people have often done: He googled himself. He searched his various aliases, an associate and the name of his book. As he did so, all of that information was captured by XKEYSCORE.\nXKEYSCORE has, however, also been used to spy on non-terrorist targets. The April 18, 2013 issue of the internal NSA publication Special Source Operations Weekly boasts [13] that analysts were successful in using XKEYSCORE to obtain U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's talking points prior to a meeting with President Obama.\n<strong>XKEYSCORE for hacking: easily collecting user names, passwords and much more</strong>\nXKEYSCORE plays a central role in how the U.S. government and its surveillance allies hack computer networks around the world. One top-secret 2009 NSA document describes how the system is used by the NSA to gather information for the Office of Tailored Access Operations, an NSA division responsible for Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) -- i.e., targeted hacking.\nParticularly in 2009, the hacking tactics enabled by XKEYSCORE would have yielded significant returns as use of encryption was less widespread than today. Jonathan Brossard, a security researcher and the CEO of Toucan Systems, told The Intercept: \"Anyone could be trained to do this in less than one day: they simply enter the name of the server they want to hack into XKEYSCORE, type enter, and are presented login and password pairs to connect to this machine. Done. Finito.\" Previous reporting [14] by The Intercept revealed that systems administrators are a popular target of the NSA. \"Who better to target than the person that already has the 'keys to the kingdom?'\" read a 2012 post on an internal NSA discussion board.\nThis system enables analysts to access web mail servers with remarkable ease. [15]\nThe same methods are used to steal the credentials -- user names and passwords -- of individual users of message boards. [16]\nHacker forums [17] are also monitored for people selling or using exploits and other hacking tools. While the NSA is clearly monitoring to understand the capabilities developed by its adversaries, it is also monitoring locations where such capabilities can be purchased.\nOther information gained via XKEYSCORE facilitates the remote exploitation of target computers. By extracting browser fingerprint and operating system versions from Internet traffic, the system allows analysts to quickly assess the exploitability of a target. [18] Brossard, the security researcher, said that \"NSA has built an impressively complete set of automated hacking tools for their analysts to use.\"\nGiven the breadth of information collected by XKEYSCORE, accessing and exploiting a target's online activity is a matter of a few mouse clicks. Brossard explains: \"The amount of work an analyst has to perform to actually break into remote computers over the Internet seems ridiculously reduced -- we are talking minutes, if not seconds. Simple. As easy as typing a few words in Google.\"\nThese facts bolster one of Snowden's most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by The Guardian [19] on June 9, 2013. \"I, sitting at my desk,\" said Snowden, could \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge to even the president, if I had a personal email.\"\nIndeed, training documents for XKEYSCORE repeatedly highlight how user-friendly the program is: with just a few clicks, any analyst with access to it can conduct sweeping searches simply by entering a person's email address, telephone number, name or other identifying data. There is no indication in the documents reviewed that prior approval is needed for specific searches.\nIn addition to login credentials and other target intelligence, XKEYSCORE collects router configuration information, [20] which it shares with Tailored Access Operations. The office is able to exploit routers and then feed the traffic traveling through those routers into their collection infrastructure. This allows the NSA to spy on traffic from otherwise out-of-reach networks. XKEYSCORE documents reference router configurations, and a document previously published by Der Spiegel [21] shows that \"active implants\" can be used to \"cop[y] traffic and direc[t]\" it past a passive collector.\n<strong>XKEYSCORE for counterintelligence</strong>\nBeyond enabling the collection, categorization, and querying of metadata and content, XKEYSCORE has also been used to monitor the surveillance and hacking actions of foreign nation states and to gather the fruits of their hacking. The Intercept previously reported [22] that NSA and its allies spy on hackers in order to collect what they collect.\nOnce the hacking tools and techniques of a foreign entity (for instance, South Korea) [23] are identified, analysts can then extract the country's espionage targets from XKEYSCORE, and gather information that the foreign power has managed to steal.\nMonitoring of foreign state hackers could allow the NSA to gather techniques and tools used by foreign actors, including knowledge of zero-day exploits--software bugs that allow attackers to hack into systems, and that not even the software vendor knows about--and implants. Additionally, by monitoring vulnerability reports sent to vendors such as Kaspersky, [24] the agency could learn when exploits they were actively using need to be retired because they've been discovered by a third party.\n<strong>Seizure v. searching: oversight, audit trail and the Fourth Amendment</strong>\nBy the nature of how it sweeps up information, XKEYSCORE gathers communications of Americans, despite the Fourth Amendment protection against \"unreasonable search and seizure\" -- including searching data without a warrant. The NSA says it does not target U.S. citizens' communications without a warrant, but acknowledges that it \"incidentally\" collects and reads some of it without one, minimizing the information that is retained or shared.<br/>\nBut that interpretation of the law is dubious at best.\nXKEYSCORE training documents say that the \"burden is on user/auditor to comply with USSID-18 or other rules,\" apparently including the British Human Rights Act (HRA), which protects the rights of U.K. citizens. U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 (USSID 18) is the American directive that governs \"U.S. person minimization.\"\nKurt Opsahl, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's general counsel, describes USSID 18 as \"an attempt by the intelligence community to comply with the Fourth Amendment. But it doesn't come from a court, it comes from the executive.\"\nIf, for instance, an analyst searched XKEYSCORE for all iPhone users, this query would violate USSID 18 [25] due to the inevitable American iPhone users that would be grabbed without a warrant, as the NSA's own training materials make clear.\nOpsahl believes that analysts are not prevented by technical means from making queries that violate USSID 18. \"The document discusses whether auditors will be happy or unhappy. This indicates that compliance will be achieved by after-the-fact auditing, not by preventing the search.\"\nScreenshots of the XKEYSCORE web-based user interface included in slides show that analysts see a prominent warning message: \"This system is audited for USSID 18 and Human Rights Act compliance.\" When analysts log in to the system, they see a more detailed message warning that \"an audit trail has been established and will be searched\" in response to HRA complaints, and as part of the USSID 18 and USSID 9 audit process.\nBecause the XKEYSCORE system does not appear to prevent analysts from making queries that would be in violation of these rules, Opsahl concludes that \"there's a tremendous amount of power being placed in the hands of analysts.\" And while those analysts may be subject to audits, \"at least in the short term they can still obtain information that they shouldn't have.\"\nDuring a symposium [26] in January 2015 hosted at Harvard University, Edward Snowden, who spoke via video call, said that NSA analysts are \"completely free from any meaningful oversight.\" Speaking about the people who audit NSA systems like XKEYSCORE for USSID 18 compliance, he said, \"The majority of the people who are doing the auditing are the friends of the analysts. They work in the same office. They're not full-time auditors, they're guys who have other duties assigned. There are a few traveling auditors who go around and look at the things that are out there, but really it's not robust.\"\nIn a statement to The Intercept, the NSA said:\n\"The National Security Agency's foreign intelligence operations are 1) authorized by law; 2) subject to multiple layers of stringent internal and external oversight; and 3) conducted in a manner that is designed to protect privacy and civil liberties. As provided for by Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28), all persons, regardless of their nationality, have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information. NSA goes to great lengths to narrowly tailor and focus its signals intelligence operations on the collection of communications that are most likely to contain foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information.\"\n<em>Coming next: A Look Under the Hood of XKEYSCORE</em>\n<em>Documents published with this article:</em>\n* <a

They come as senior intelligence officials testify to the Senate judiciary committee on Wednesday, releasing classified documents in response to the Guardian's earlier stories on bulk collection of phone records and Fisa surveillance court oversight. [1]\nThe files shed light on one of Snowden's most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by the Guardian on June 10. [2]\n\"I, sitting at my desk,\" said Snowden, could \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge or even the president, if I had a personal email\".\nUS officials vehemently denied this specific claim. Mike Rogers, the Republican chairman of the House intelligence committee, said of Snowden's assertion: \"He's lying. It's impossible for him to do what he was saying he could do.\"\nBut training materials for XKeyscore detail how analysts can use it and other systems to mine enormous agency databases by filling in a simple on-screen form giving only a broad justification for the search. The request is not reviewed by a court or any NSA personnel before it is processed.\nXKeyscore, the documents boast, is the NSA's \"widest reaching\" system developing intelligence from computer networks -- what the agency calls Digital Network Intelligence (DNI). One presentation claims the program covers \"nearly everything a typical user does on the internet\", including the content of emails, websites visited and searches, as well as their metadata.\nAnalysts can also use XKeyscore and other NSA systems to obtain ongoing \"real-time\" interception of an individual's internet activity.\nUnder US law, the NSA is required to obtain an individualized Fisa warrant only if the target of their surveillance is a 'US person', though no such warrant is required for intercepting the communications of Americans with foreign targets. But XKeyscore provides the technological capability, if not the legal authority, to target even US persons for extensive electronic surveillance without a warrant provided that some identifying information, such as their email or IP address, is known to the analyst.\nOne training slide illustrates the digital activity constantly being collected by XKeyscore and the analyst's ability to query the databases at any time.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"347\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS1-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nThe purpose of XKeyscore is to allow analysts to search the metadata as well as the content of emails and other internet activity, such as browser history, even when there is no known email account (a \"selector\" in NSA parlance) associated with the individual being targeted.\nAnalysts can also search by name, telephone number, IP address, keywords, the language in which the internet activity was conducted or the type of browser used.\nOne document notes that this is because \"strong selection [search by email address] itself gives us only a very limited capability\" because \"a large amount of time spent on the web is performing actions that are anonymous.\"\nThe NSA documents assert that by 2008, 300 terrorists had been captured using intelligence from XKeyscore.\nAnalysts are warned that searching the full database for content will yield too many results to sift through. Instead they are advised to use the metadata also stored in the databases to narrow down what to review.\nA slide entitled \"plug-ins\" in a December 2012 document describes the various fields of information that can be searched. It includes \"every email address seen in a session by both username and domain\", \"every phone number seen in a session (eg address book entries or signature block)\" and user activity -- \"the webmail and chat activity to include username, buddylist, machine specific cookies etc\".\n<strong>Email monitoring</strong><br/>\nIn a second Guardian interview in June, Snowden elaborated on his statement about being able to read any individual's email if he had their email address. He said the claim was based in part on the email search capabilities of XKeyscore, which Snowden says he was authorized to use while working as a Booz Allen contractor for the NSA.\nOne top-secret document describes how the program \"searches within bodies of emails, webpages and documents\", including the \"To, From, CC, BCC lines\" and the 'Contact Us' pages on websites\".\nTo search for emails, an analyst using XKS enters the individual's email address into a simple online search form, along with the \"justification\" for the search and the time period for which the emails are sought.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS2-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"345\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS3edit2-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nThe analyst then selects which of those returned emails they want to read by opening them in NSA reading software.\nThe system is similar to the way in which NSA analysts generally can intercept the communications of anyone they select, including, as one NSA document put it, \"communications that transit the United States and communications that terminate in the United States\".\nOne document, a top secret 2010 guide describing the training received by NSA analysts for general surveillance under the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008, explains that analysts can begin surveillance on anyone by clicking a few simple pull-down menus designed to provide both legal and targeting justifications. Once options on the pull-down menus are selected, their target is marked for electronic surveillance and the analyst is able to review the content of their communications:\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"353\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS4-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<strong>Chats, browsing history and other internet activity</strong><br/>\nBeyond emails, the XKeyscore system allows analysts to monitor a virtually unlimited array of other internet activities, including those within social media.\nAn NSA tool called DNI Presenter, used to read the content of stored emails, also enables an analyst using XKeyscore to read the content of Facebook chats or private messages.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"333\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS55edit-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nAn analyst can monitor such Facebook chats by entering the Facebook user name and a date range into a simple search screen.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"314\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS6-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>Analysts can search for internet browsing activities using a wide range of information, including search terms entered by the user or the websites viewed.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"329\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS7-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>As one slide indicates, the ability to search HTTP activity by keyword permits the analyst access to what the NSA calls \"nearly everything a typical user does on the internet\".<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"324\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS8-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>The XKeyscore program also allows an analyst to learn the IP addresses of every person who visits any website the analyst specifies.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" height=\"258\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS9-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\n<br/>The quantity of communications accessible through programs such as XKeyscore is staggeringly large. One NSA report from 2007 estimated that there were 850bn \"call events\" collected and stored in the NSA databases, and close to 150bn internet records. Each day, the document says, 1-2bn records were added.\nWilliam Binney, a former NSA mathematician, said last year that the agency had \"assembled on the order of 20tn transactions about US citizens with other US citizens\", an estimate, he said, that \"only was involving phone calls and emails\". A 2010 Washington Post article reported that \"every day, collection systems at the [NSA] intercept and store 1.7bn emails, phone calls and other type of communications.\"\nThe XKeyscore system is continuously collecting so much internet data that it can be stored only for short periods of time. Content remains on the system for only three to five days, while metadata is stored for 30 days. One document explains: \"At some sites, the amount of data we receive per day (20+ terabytes) can only be stored for as little as 24 hours.\"\nTo solve this problem, the NSA has created a multi-tiered system that allows analysts to store \"interesting\" content in other databases, such as one named Pinwale which can store material for up to five years. \nIt is the databases of XKeyscore, one document shows, that now contain the greatest amount of communications data collected by the NSA.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"325\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS10-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nIn 2012, there were at least 41 billion total records collected and stored in XKeyscore for a single 30-day period.<br/>\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"187\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS11-002.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"220\"/><br/>\n<br/><strong>Legal v technical restrictions</strong><br/>\nWhile the Fisa Amendments Act of 2008 requires an individualized warrant for the targeting of US persons, NSA analysts are permitted to intercept the communications of such individuals without a warrant if they are in contact with one of the NSA's foreign targets.\nThe ACLU's deputy legal director, Jameel Jaffer, told the Guardian last month that national security officials expressly said that a primary purpose of the new law was to enable them to collect large amounts of Americans' communications without individualized warrants.\n\"The government doesn't need to 'target' Americans in order to collect huge volumes of their communications,\" said Jaffer. \"The government inevitably sweeps up the communications of many Americans\" when targeting foreign nationals for surveillance.\nAn example is provided by one XKeyscore document showing an NSA target in Tehran communicating with people in Frankfurt, Amsterdam and New York.\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"257\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2013/KS12-001.jpg\" title=\"\" width=\"460\"/><br/>\nIn recent years, the NSA has attempted to segregate exclusively domestic US communications in separate databases. But even NSA documents acknowledge that such efforts are imperfect, as even purely domestic communications can travel on foreign systems, and NSA tools are sometimes unable to identify the national origins of communications.\nMoreover, all communications between Americans and someone on foreign soil are included in the same databases as foreign-to-foreign communications, making them readily searchable without warrants.\nSome searches conducted by NSA analysts are periodically reviewed by their supervisors within the NSA. \"It's very rare to be questioned on our searches,\" Snowden told the Guardian in June, \"and even when we are, it's usually along the lines of: 'let's bulk up the justification'.\"\nIn a letter this week to senator Ron Wyden, director of national intelligence James Clapper acknowledged that NSA analysts have exceeded even legal limits as interpreted by the NSA in domestic surveillance.\nAcknowledging what he called \"a number of compliance problems\", Clapper attributed them to \"human error\" or \"highly sophisticated technology issues\" rather than \"bad faith\".\nHowever, Wyden said on the Senate floor on Tuesday: \"These violations are more serious than those stated by the intelligence community, and are troubling.\"\nIn a statement to the Guardian, the NSA said: \"NSA's activities are focused and specifically deployed against -- and only against -- legitimate foreign intelligence targets in response to requirements that our leaders need for information necessary to protect our nation and its interests.\n\"XKeyscore is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system.\n\"Allegations of widespread, unchecked analyst access to NSA collection data are simply not true. Access to XKeyscore, as well as all of NSA's analytic tools, is limited to only those personnel who require access for their assigned tasks ... In addition, there are multiple technical, manual and supervisory checks and balances within the system to prevent deliberate misuse from occurring.\"\n\"Every search by an NSA analyst is fully auditable, to ensure that they are proper and within the law.\n\"These types of programs allow us to collect the information that enables us to perform our missions successfully -- to defend the nation and to protect US and allied troops abroad.\"\n[1] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files\" title=\"\">http://www.theguardian.com/world/the-nsa-files</a><br/>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video\" title=\"\">http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview-video</a>\n</div>",

Today, The Intercept is publishing 48 top-secret and other classified documents about XKEYSCORE dated up to 2013, which shed new light on the breadth, depth and functionality of this critical spy system -- one of the largest releases yet of documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden.\nThe NSA's XKEYSCORE program, first revealed [1] by The Guardian, sweeps up countless people's Internet searches, emails, documents, usernames and passwords, and other private communications. XKEYSCORE is fed a constant flow of Internet traffic from fiber optic cables [2] that make up the backbone of the world's communication network, among other sources, for processing. As of 2008, the surveillance system boasted approximately 150 field sites in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, United Kingdom, Spain, Russia, Nigeria, Somalia, Pakistan, Japan, Australia, as well as many other countries, consisting of over 700 servers.\nThese servers store \"full-take data\" at the collection sites -- meaning that they captured all of the traffic collected -- and, as of 2009, stored content for 3 to 5 days and metadata for 30 to 45 days. NSA documents indicate that tens of billions of records are stored in its database. \"It is a fully distributed processing and query system that runs on machines around the world,\" an NSA briefing on XKEYSCORE says. \"At field sites, XKEYSCORE can run on multiple computers that gives it the ability to scale in both processing power and storage.\"\nXKEYSCORE also collects and processes Internet traffic from Americans, though NSA analysts are taught to avoid querying the system in ways that might result in spying on U.S. data. Experts and privacy activists, however, have long doubted that such exclusions are effective in preventing large amounts of American data from being swept up. One document The Intercept is publishing today suggests that FISA warrants have authorized \"full-take\" collection of traffic from at least some U.S. web forums.\nThe system is not limited to collecting web traffic. The 2013 document, \"VoIP Configuration and Forwarding Read Me,\" details how to forward VoIP data from XKEYSCORE into NUCLEON, NSA's repository for voice intercepts, facsimile, video and \"pre-released transcription.\" At the time, it supported more than 8,000 users globally and was made up of 75 servers absorbing 700,000 voice, fax, video and tag files per day.\nThe reach and potency of XKEYSCORE as a surveillance instrument is astonishing. The Guardian report noted that NSA itself refers to the program as its \"widest reaching\" system. In February of this year, The Intercept reported [3] that NSA and GCHQ hacked into the internal network of Gemalto, the world's largest provider of cell phone SIM cards, in order to steal millions of encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cell phone communication. XKEYSCORE played a vital role in the spies' hacking by providing government hackers access to the email accounts of Gemalto employees.\nNumerous key NSA partners, including Canada, New Zealand and the U.K., have access to the mass surveillance databases of XKEYSCORE. In March, the New Zealand Herald, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed [4] that the New Zealand government used XKEYSCORE to spy on candidates for the position of World Trade Organization director general and also members of the Solomon Islands government. [5]\nThese newly published documents demonstrate that collected communications not only include emails, chats and web-browsing traffic, but also pictures, documents, voice calls, webcam photos, web searches, advertising analytics traffic, social media traffic, botnet traffic, logged keystrokes, computer network exploitation (CNE) targeting, intercepted username and password pairs, file uploads to online services, Skype sessions and more.\n<strong>Bulk collection and population surveillance</strong>\nXKEYSCORE allows for incredibly broad surveillance of people based on perceived patterns of suspicious behavior. It is possible, for instance, to query the system to show the activities of people based on their location, nationality and websites visited. For instance, one slide displays the search \"germansinpakistn,\" showing an analyst querying XKEYSCORE for all individuals in Pakistan visiting specific German language message boards. [6]\nAs sites like Twitter and Facebook become increasingly significant in the world's day-to-day communications (a Pew study shows [7] that 71 percent of online adults in the U.S. use Facebook), they become a critical source of surveillance data. Traffic from popular social media sites is described as \"a great starting point\" for tracking individuals, according to an XKEYSCORE presentation [8] titled \"Tracking Targets on Online Social Networks.\"\nWhen intelligence agencies collect massive amounts of Internet traffic all over the world, they face the challenge of making sense of that data. The vast quantities collected make it difficult to connect the stored traffic to specific individuals.\nInternet companies have also encountered this problem and have solved it by tracking their users with identifiers that are unique to each individual, often in the form of browser cookies. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store in visitors' browsers. They are used for a variety of purposes, including authenticating users (cookies make it possible to log in to websites), storing preferences, and uniquely tracking individuals even if they're using the same IP address as many other people. Websites also embed code used by third-party services to collect analytics or host ads, which also use cookies to track users. According to one slide, [9] \"Almost all websites have cookies enabled.\"\nThe NSA's ability to piggyback off of private companies' tracking of their own users is a vital instrument that allows the agency to trace the data it collects to individual users. It makes no difference if visitors switch to public Wi-Fi networks or connect to VPNs to change their IP addresses: the tracking cookie will follow them around as long as they are using the same web browser and fail to clear their cookies.\nApps that run on tablets and smartphones also use analytics services that uniquely track users. Almost every time a user sees an advertisement (in an app or in a web browser), the ad network is tracking users in the same way. A secret GCHQ and CSE program called BADASS, [10] which is similar to XKEYSCORE but with a much narrower scope, mines as much valuable information from leaky smartphone apps as possible, including unique tracking identifiers that app developers use to track their own users. In May of this year, CBC, in partnership with The Intercept, revealed [11] that XKEYSCORE was used to track smartphone connections to the app marketplaces run by Samsung and Google. Surveillance agency analysts also use other types of traffic data that gets scooped into XKEYSCORE to track people, such as Windows crash reports. [12]\nIn a statement to The Intercept, the NSA reiterated its position that such sweeping surveillance capabilities are needed to fight the War on Terror:\n\"The U.S. Government calls on its intelligence agencies to protect the United States, its citizens, and its allies from a wide array of serious threats. These threats include terrorist plots from al-Qaeda, ISIL, and others; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; foreign aggression against the United States and our allies; and international criminal organizations.\"\nIndeed, one of the specific examples of XKEYSCORE applications given in the documents is spying on Shaykh Atiyatallah, an al Qaeda senior leader and Osama bin Laden confidant. A few years before his death, Atiyatallah did what many people have often done: He googled himself. He searched his various aliases, an associate and the name of his book. As he did so, all of that information was captured by XKEYSCORE.\nXKEYSCORE has, however, also been used to spy on non-terrorist targets. The April 18, 2013 issue of the internal NSA publication Special Source Operations Weekly boasts [13] that analysts were successful in using XKEYSCORE to obtain U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's talking points prior to a meeting with President Obama.\n<strong>XKEYSCORE for hacking: easily collecting user names, passwords and much more</strong>\nXKEYSCORE plays a central role in how the U.S. government and its surveillance allies hack computer networks around the world. One top-secret 2009 NSA document describes how the system is used by the NSA to gather information for the Office of Tailored Access Operations, an NSA division responsible for Computer Network Exploitation (CNE) -- i.e., targeted hacking.\nParticularly in 2009, the hacking tactics enabled by XKEYSCORE would have yielded significant returns as use of encryption was less widespread than today. Jonathan Brossard, a security researcher and the CEO of Toucan Systems, told The Intercept: \"Anyone could be trained to do this in less than one day: they simply enter the name of the server they want to hack into XKEYSCORE, type enter, and are presented login and password pairs to connect to this machine. Done. Finito.\" Previous reporting [14] by The Intercept revealed that systems administrators are a popular target of the NSA. \"Who better to target than the person that already has the 'keys to the kingdom?'\" read a 2012 post on an internal NSA discussion board.\nThis system enables analysts to access web mail servers with remarkable ease. [15]\nThe same methods are used to steal the credentials -- user names and passwords -- of individual users of message boards. [16]\nHacker forums [17] are also monitored for people selling or using exploits and other hacking tools. While the NSA is clearly monitoring to understand the capabilities developed by its adversaries, it is also monitoring locations where such capabilities can be purchased.\nOther information gained via XKEYSCORE facilitates the remote exploitation of target computers. By extracting browser fingerprint and operating system versions from Internet traffic, the system allows analysts to quickly assess the exploitability of a target. [18] Brossard, the security researcher, said that \"NSA has built an impressively complete set of automated hacking tools for their analysts to use.\"\nGiven the breadth of information collected by XKEYSCORE, accessing and exploiting a target's online activity is a matter of a few mouse clicks. Brossard explains: \"The amount of work an analyst has to perform to actually break into remote computers over the Internet seems ridiculously reduced -- we are talking minutes, if not seconds. Simple. As easy as typing a few words in Google.\"\nThese facts bolster one of Snowden's most controversial statements, made in his first video interview published by The Guardian [19] on June 9, 2013. \"I, sitting at my desk,\" said Snowden, could \"wiretap anyone, from you or your accountant, to a federal judge to even the president, if I had a personal email.\"\nIndeed, training documents for XKEYSCORE repeatedly highlight how user-friendly the program is: with just a few clicks, any analyst with access to it can conduct sweeping searches simply by entering a person's email address, telephone number, name or other identifying data. There is no indication in the documents reviewed that prior approval is needed for specific searches.\nIn addition to login credentials and other target intelligence, XKEYSCORE collects router configuration information, [20] which it shares with Tailored Access Operations. The office is able to exploit routers and then feed the traffic traveling through those routers into their collection infrastructure. This allows the NSA to spy on traffic from otherwise out-of-reach networks. XKEYSCORE documents reference router configurations, and a document previously published by Der Spiegel [21] shows that \"active implants\" can be used to \"cop[y] traffic and direc[t]\" it past a passive collector.\n<strong>XKEYSCORE for counterintelligence</strong>\nBeyond enabling the collection, categorization, and querying of metadata and content, XKEYSCORE has also been used to monitor the surveillance and hacking actions of foreign nation states and to gather the fruits of their hacking. The Intercept previously reported [22] that NSA and its allies spy on hackers in order to collect what they collect.\nOnce the hacking tools and techniques of a foreign entity (for instance, South Korea) [23] are identified, analysts can then extract the country's espionage targets from XKEYSCORE, and gather information that the foreign power has managed to steal.\nMonitoring of foreign state hackers could allow the NSA to gather techniques and tools used by foreign actors, including knowledge of zero-day exploits--software bugs that allow attackers to hack into systems, and that not even the software vendor knows about--and implants. Additionally, by monitoring vulnerability reports sent to vendors such as Kaspersky, [24] the agency could learn when exploits they were actively using need to be retired because they've been discovered by a third party.\n<strong>Seizure v. searching: oversight, audit trail and the Fourth Amendment</strong>\nBy the nature of how it sweeps up information, XKEYSCORE gathers communications of Americans, despite the Fourth Amendment protection against \"unreasonable search and seizure\" -- including searching data without a warrant. The NSA says it does not target U.S. citizens' communications without a warrant, but acknowledges that it \"incidentally\" collects and reads some of it without one, minimizing the information that is retained or shared.<br/>\nBut that interpretation of the law is dubious at best.\nXKEYSCORE training documents say that the \"burden is on user/auditor to comply with USSID-18 or other rules,\" apparently including the British Human Rights Act (HRA), which protects the rights of U.K. citizens. U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 (USSID 18) is the American directive that governs \"U.S. person minimization.\"\nKurt Opsahl, the Electronic Frontier Foundation's general counsel, describes USSID 18 as \"an attempt by the intelligence community to comply with the Fourth Amendment. But it doesn't come from a court, it comes from the executive.\"\nIf, for instance, an analyst searched XKEYSCORE for all iPhone users, this query would violate USSID 18 [25] due to the inevitable American iPhone users that would be grabbed without a warrant, as the NSA's own training materials make clear.\nOpsahl believes that analysts are not prevented by technical means from making queries that violate USSID 18. \"The document discusses whether auditors will be happy or unhappy. This indicates that compliance will be achieved by after-the-fact auditing, not by preventing the search.\"\nScreenshots of the XKEYSCORE web-based user interface included in slides show that analysts see a prominent warning message: \"This system is audited for USSID 18 and Human Rights Act compliance.\" When analysts log in to the system, they see a more detailed message warning that \"an audit trail has been established and will be searched\" in response to HRA complaints, and as part of the USSID 18 and USSID 9 audit process.\nBecause the XKEYSCORE system does not appear to prevent analysts from making queries that would be in violation of these rules, Opsahl concludes that \"there's a tremendous amount of power being placed in the hands of analysts.\" And while those analysts may be subject to audits, \"at least in the short term they can still obtain information that they shouldn't have.\"\nDuring a symposium [26] in January 2015 hosted at Harvard University, Edward Snowden, who spoke via video call, said that NSA analysts are \"completely free from any meaningful oversight.\" Speaking about the people who audit NSA systems like XKEYSCORE for USSID 18 compliance, he said, \"The majority of the people who are doing the auditing are the friends of the analysts. They work in the same office. They're not full-time auditors, they're guys who have other duties assigned. There are a few traveling auditors who go around and look at the things that are out there, but really it's not robust.\"\nIn a statement to The Intercept, the NSA said:\n\"The National Security Agency's foreign intelligence operations are 1) authorized by law; 2) subject to multiple layers of stringent internal and external oversight; and 3) conducted in a manner that is designed to protect privacy and civil liberties. As provided for by Presidential Policy Directive 28 (PPD-28), all persons, regardless of their nationality, have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information. NSA goes to great lengths to narrowly tailor and focus its signals intelligence operations on the collection of communications that are most likely to contain foreign intelligence or counterintelligence information.\"\n<em>Coming next: A Look Under the Hood of XKEYSCORE</em>\n<em>Documents published with this article:</em>\n* <a

Appelbaum, A. Gibson, J. Goetz, V. Kabisch, L. Kampf, L. Ryge\nThe investigation discloses the following:\n* Two servers in Germany - in Berlin and Nuremberg - are under surveillance by the NSA.\n* Merely searching the web for the privacy-enhancing software tools outlined in the XKeyscore rules causes the NSA to mark and track the IP address of the person doing the search. Not only are German privacy software users tracked, but the source code shows that privacy software users worldwide are tracked by the NSA.\n* Among the NSA's targets is the Tor network funded primarily by the US government to aid democracy advocates in authoritarian states.\n* The XKeyscore rules reveal that the NSA tracks all connections to a server that hosts part of an anonymous email service at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It also records details about visits to a popular internet journal for Linux operating system users called \"the Linux Journal - the Original Magazine of the Linux Community\", and calls it an \"extremist forum\".\n\n<blockquote><strong>Disclosure</strong>\nThree authors of this investigation have personal and professional ties to the Tor Project, an American company mentioned within the following investigation. Jacob Appelbaum is a paid employee of the Tor Project, Aaron Gibson is a paid contractor for the Tor Project, and Leif Ryge is a volunteer contributor to various Tor-related software projects. Their research in this story is wholly independent from the Tor Project and does not reflect the views of the Tor Project in any way. During the course of the investigation, it was further discovered that an additional computer system run by Jacob Appelbaum for his volunteer work with helping to run part of the Tor network was targeted by the NSA. Moreover, all members of this team are Tor users and appear to be have been targets of the mass surveillance described in the investigation.</blockquote>\n\nIt is a small server that looks like any of the other dozens in the same row. It is in a large room devoted to computers and computer storage, just like every other room in this industrial park building on Am Tower Street just outside the city of Nuremberg. That the grey building is surrounded by barbed wire seems to indicate that the servers' provider is working hard to secure their customers' data.\nYet despite these efforts, one of the servers is targeted by the NSA.\nThe IP address 212.212.245.170 is explicitly specified in the rules of the powerful and invasive spy software program XKeyscore. The code is published here exclusively for the first time.\nAfter a year of NSA revelations based on documents that focus on program names and high-level Powerpoint presentations, NDR and WDR are revealing NSA source code that shows how these programs function and how they are implemented in Germany and around the world.\nMonths of investigation by the German public television broadcasters NDR and WDR, drawing on exclusive access to top secret NSA source code, interviews with former NSA employees, and the review of secret documents of the German government reveal that not only is the server in Nuremberg under observation by the NSA, but so is virtually anyone who has taken an interest in several well-known privacy software systems.\nThe NSA program XKeyscore is a collection and analysis tool and \"a computer network exploitation system\", as described in an NSA presentation. It is one of the agency's most ambitious programs devoted to gathering \"nearly everything a user does on the internet.\" The source code contains several rules that enable agents using XKeyscore to surveil privacy-conscious internet users around the world. The rules published here are specifically directed at the infrastructure and the users of the Tor Network, the Tails operating system, and other privacy-related software.\nTor, also known as The Onion Router, is a network of several thousand volunteer-operated servers, or nodes, that work in concert to conceal Tor users' IP addresses and thus keep them anonymous while online.\nTails is a privacy-focused GNU/Linux-based operating system that runs entirely from an external storage device such as a USB stick or CD. It comes with Tor and other privacy tools pre-installed and configured, and each time it reboots it automatically wipes everything that is not saved on an encrypted persistent storage medium.\nNormally a user's online traffic - such as emails, instant messages, searches, or visits to websites - can be attributed to the IP address assigned to them by their internet service provider. When a user goes online over the Tor Network, their connections are relayed through a number of Tor nodes using another layer of encryption between each server such that the first server cannot see where the last server is located and vice-versa.\nTor is used by private individuals who want to conceal their online activity, human rights activists in oppressive regimes such as China and Iran, journalists who want to protect their sources, and even by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency in their efforts to infiltrate criminal groups without revealing their identity. The Tor Project is a non-profit charity based in Massachusetts and is primarily funded by government agencies. Thus it is ironic that the Tor Network has become such a high-priority target in the NSA's worldwide surveillance system.\nAs revealed by the British newspaper The Guardian, there have been repeated efforts to crack the Tor Network and de-anonymize its users. The top secret presentations published in October last year show that Tor is anathema to the NSA. In one presentation, agents refer to the network as \"the king of high-secure, low-latency internet anonymity\". Another is titled \"Tor Stinks\". Despite the snide remarks, the agents admit, \"We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time\".\nThe former NSA director General Keith Alexander stated that all those communicating with encryption will be regarded as terror suspects and will be monitored and stored as a method of prevention, as quoted by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in August last year. The top secret source code published here indicates that the NSA is making a concerted effort to combat any and all anonymous spaces that remain on the internet. Merely visiting privacy-related websites is enough for a user's IP address to be logged into an NSA database.\nAn examination of the XKeyscore rules published here goes beyond the slide presentation and provides a window into the actual instructions given to NSA computers. The code was deployed recently and former NSA employees and experts are convinced that the same code or similar code is still in use today. The XKeyscore rules include elements known as \"appids\", \"fingerprints\", and \"microplugins\". Each connection a user makes online - to a search engine, for example - can be assigned a single appid and any number of fingerprints.\nAppids are unique identifiers for a connection in XKeyscore. Appid rules have weights assigned to them.  When multiple appids match a given connection, the one with the highest weight is chosen. Microplugins may contain software written in general-purpose programming languages, such as C++, which can extract and store specific types of data. The rules specifically target the Tor Project's email and web infrastructure, as well as servers operated by key volunteers in Germany, the United States, Sweden, Austria, and the Netherlands. Beyond being ethically questionable, the attacks on Tor also raise legal concerns.  The IP addresses of Tor servers in the United States are amongst the targets, which could violate the fourth amendment of the US constitution.\nThe German attorney Thomas Stadler, who specializes in IT law, commented: \"The fact that a German citizen is specifically traced by the NSA, in my opinion, justifies the reasonable suspicion of the NSA carrying out secret service activities in Germany. For this reason, the German Federal Public Prosecutor should look into this matter and initiate preliminary proceedings.\"\nOne of NSA's German targets is 212.212.245.170.  The string of numbers is an IP address assigned to Sebastian Hahn, a computer science student at the University of Erlangen. Hahn operates the server out of a grey high-security building a few kilometers from where he lives. Hahn, 28 years old and sporting a red beard, volunteers for the Tor Project in his free time. He is especially trusted by the Tor community, as his server is not just a node, it is a so-called Directory Authority. There are nine of these worldwide, and they are central to the Tor Network, as they contain an index of all Tor nodes. A user's traffic is automatically directed to one of the directory authorities to download the newest list of Tor relays generated each hour.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode102_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>\"anonymizer/tor/node/authority\" fingerprint.</em>\nHahn's predecessor named the server Gabelmoo, or Fork Man, the nickname of a local statue of Poseidon. After a look at the NSA source code, Hahn quickly found his server's name listed in the XKeyscore rules. \"Yes, I recognize the IP address of my Tor server called 'gabelmoo'.\" he said. \"Millions of people use it to stay safe online, and by watching the server and collecting metadata about its users, those people are put at risk.\" The rule shown to Hahn, published below, has a fingerprint called 'anonymizer/tor/node/authority'. The fingerprint targets users who connect to Gabelmoo and other Tor Directory Authority servers. In Germany, the Tor Directory Authorities like Gabelmoo that are specifically targeted by XKeyscore rules are in Berlin and Nuremberg. Additional targets are located in Austria, Sweden, the United States, and the Netherlands.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode110_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>Fragments of XKeyscore rules targetting Tor directory authorities.</em>\nThe expression below performs essentially the same function, but it specifies the Tor directory authorities located in Five Eyes countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States) separately from those in other countries. As the comment explains, the \"goal is to find potential Tor clients connecting to the Tor directory servers.\"\nAnother rule catalogs users connecting to known Tor relays. This is not difficult, because the addresses of all normal Tor relays are published by the directory authorities so that the Tor software on users' computers can select its own path through the network. In addition to the public relays, connections characterized as Tor based on protocol identifiers are also cataloged.\n<strong>Not only Metadata</strong>\nInternet service providers in countries with strong censorship such as China and Iran frequently block connections to known Tor relays. To avoid this blocking, The Tor Project maintains a list of non-public relays called \"bridges\" to allow users to avoid this type of blocking. Bridges are run by volunteers and they share the details with the Tor Project to help censored users reach the internet.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode108_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>Microplugin which extracts bridge addresses from the full text of Tor Project emails.</em>\nUsers can request a bridge address via email or on the web. The following fingerprints show two ways that XKeyscore attempts to track Tor bridge users. First, the fingerprint \"anonymizer/tor/bridge/tls\" records connections to the bridges.torproject.org server. Second, in order obtain the actual bridge addresses for the purpose of tracking connections to them in the future, the \"microplugin\" fingerprint called \"anonymizer/tor/bridge/email\" extracts data from the body of the emails that the Tor Project sends to its users.\nThis code demonstrates the ease with which an XKeyscore rule can analyze the full content of intercepted connections. The fingerprint first checks every message using the \"email_address\" function to see if the message is to or from \"bridges@torproject.org\". Next, if the address matched, it uses the \"email_body\" function to search the full content of the email for a particular piece of text - in this case, \"https://bridges.torproject.org/\". If the \"email_body\" function finds what it is looking for, it passes the full email text to a C++ program which extracts the bridge addresses and stores them in a database.\nThe full content of the email must already be intercepted before this code can analyze it. XKeyscore also keeps track of people who are not using Tor, but who are merely visiting The Tor Project's website (www.torproject.org), as this rule demonstrates:\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode106_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>Fingerprint to identify visitors to the Tor Project website.</em>\nThe full content of the email must already be intercepted before this code can analyze it. XKeyscore also keeps track of people who are not using Tor, but who are merely visiting The Tor Project's website (www.torproject.org), as this rule demonstrates:\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode104_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>Rules targeting people viewing the Tails or Linux Journal websites, or performing Tails-related web searches.</em>\nIt is interesting to note that this rule specifically avoids fingerprinting users believed to be located in Five Eyes countries, while other rules make no such distinction. For instance, the following fingerprint targets users visiting the Tails and Linux Journal websites, or performing certain web searches related to Tails, and makes no distinction about the country of the user.\nThe comment in the  source code above describes Tails as \"a comsec mechanism advocated by extremists on extremist forums\". In actuality, the software is used by journalists, human rights activists, and hundreds of thousands of ordinary people who merely wish to protect their privacy.\nThe rules related to Tails clearly demonstrate how easily web searches and website visits can be spied on by XKeyscore. On June 25, 2014, the United States Supreme Court noted how sensitive this type of information is in their Riley v. California decision against warrantless searches of mobile phones: \"An Internet search and browsing history [...] could reveal an individual's private interests or concerns - perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease, coupled with frequent visits to WebMD.\"\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode100_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>C++ program which searches \"raw traffic\" for .onion addresses.</em>\nIn addition to anonymous internet access, Tor also provides a mechanism for hosting anonymous internet services called \"Hidden Services\". These sites' URLs contain a domain name in the pseudo-top-level-domain \".onion\" which is only accessible using Tor. The code shown below finds and catalogs URLs for these sites which XKeyscore sees in \"raw traffic\", creating a unique fingerprint for each onion address. Each .onion address found in raw traffic is extracted and stored in an NSA database:\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2014/nsasourcecode112_v-ardgalerie.jpg\" style=\"width: 784px; height: 441px;\"/><br/>\n<em>\"anonymizer/mailer/mixminion\" appid matching all connections to 128.31.0.34.</em>\nThere are also rules that target users of numerous other privacy-focused internet services, including HotSpotShield, FreeNet, Centurian, FreeProxies.org, MegaProxy, privacy.li and an anonymous email service called MixMinion as well as its predecessor MixMaster. The appid rule for MixMinion is extremely broad as it matches all traffic to or from the IP address 128.31.0.34, a server located on the MIT campus.\nThat server is operated by the Tor Project's leader Roger Dingledine, an MIT alumnus. The machine at this IP address provides many services besides MixMinion, and it is also one of the above-mentioned Tor directory authorities. Dingledine said \"That computer hosts many websites, ranging from open source gaming libraries to the Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium website.\"\nSebastian Hahn, the Tor volunteer who runs Gabelmoo, was stunned to learn that his hobby could interest the NSA: \"This shows that Tor is working well enough that Tor has become a target for the intelligence services. For me this means that I will definitely go ahead with the project.\"\nWhen asked for a reaction to the findings, the Tor Project's Roger Dingledine stated the following: \"We've been thinking of state surveillance for years because of our work in places where journalists are threatened. Tor's anonymity is based on distributed trust, so observing traffic at one place in the Tor network, even a directory authority, isn't enough to break it. Tor has gone mainstream in the past few years, and its wide diversity of users - from civic-minded individuals and ordinary consumers to activists, law enforcement, and companies - is part of its security. Just learning that somebody visited the Tor or Tails website doesn't tell you whether that person is a journalist source, someone concerned that her Internet Service Provider will learn about her health conditions, or just someone irked that cat videos are blocked in her location. Trying to make a list of Tor's millions of daily users certainly counts as wide scale collection. Their attack on the bridge address distribution service shows their 'collect all the things' mentality - it's worth emphasizing that we designed bridges for users in countries like China and Iran, and here we are finding out about attacks by our own country. Does reading the contents of those mails violate the wiretap act? Now I understand how the Google engineers felt when they learned about the attacks on their infrastructure.\"\nNDR and WDR wanted to know from the NSA how it justified attacking a service funded by the U.S. government, under what legal authority Tor Network users are monitored, and whether the German government has any knowledge of the targeting of servers in Germany. Instead of adressing the questions repeatedly posed to them, the NSA provided the following statement: \"In carrying out its mission, NSA collects only what it is authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence purposes - regardless of the technical means used by foreign intelligence targets. The communications of people who are not foreign intelligence targets are of no use to the agency. In January, President Obama issued U.S. Presidential Policy Directive 28, which affirms that all persons - regardless of nationality - have legitimate privacy interests in the handling of their personal information, and that privacy and civil liberties shall be integral considerations in the planning of U.S. signals intelligence activities. The president's  directive also makes clear that the United States does not collect signals intelligence for the purpose of suppressing or burdening criticism or dissent, or for disadvantaging persons based on their ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion. XKeyscore is an analytic tool that is used as a part of NSA's lawful foreign signals intelligence collection system. Such tools have stringent oversight and compliance mechanisms built in at several levels. The use of XKeyscore allows the agency to help defend the nation and protect U.S. and allied troops abroad. All of NSA's operations are conducted in strict accordance with the rule of law, including the President's new directive.\"\nHowever, the research contradicts the United States' promise to Germany that German citizens are not surveiled without suspicion. Using Tor in Germany does not justify targeting someone, the German attorney Thomas Stadler states: \"Tor users do not breach any laws, it is absolutely legitimate to act anonymously on the internet. There are many good reasons to remain anonymous.\"\n\n<blockquote><strong>What is deep packet inspection?</strong>\nDeep Packet Inspection, or DPI, refers to the class of technology which examines the content of data packets as they travel across a network. A packet is the fundamental unit of transfer in packet switched networks like the internet. While DPI is commonly used by organizations to monitor their own networks, its use on public networks for censorship and surveillance has been widely condemned by privacy advocates and the United States government alike.\nIn 2012, the head of the U.S. Delegation to the World Conference on International Telecommunications, U.S. Ambassador Terry Kramer, said \"some companies have used deep packet inspection technologies to not look at aggregate customer information, traffic information, et cetera, but to look at individual customer information. So looking at individuals and what sites they're on and how much capacity they're using, et cetera, as you can imagine, we're very much opposed to that because we feel that's a violation of people's privacy and gets into, obviously, censorship, et cetera\".\nDespite its public political condemnations of invasive DPI use, the United States \"Intelligence Community\" and its \"Five Eyes\" partners (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom) operate massive internet-scale DPI systems themselves, including XKeyscore. The use of XKeyscore is not limited to these partners, however. The software has been shared with the German BND and BfV, as well as the Swedish FRA, amongst others.\n<strong>Active vs Passive</strong>\nXKeyscore and the systems that feed it are considered \"passive\", meaning that they silently listen but do not transmit anything on the networks that they are targeting. However, through a process known as \"tipping\", data from these programs can trigger other systems which perform \"active\" attacks.\nQuantum is a family of such programs, including Quantuminsert, Quantumhand, Quantumtheory, Quantumbot, and Quantumcopper, which are used for offensive computer intrusion. Turmoil, Quantum, and other components of the Turbulence architecture are running at so-called \"defensive sites\" including the Ramstein Air Force base in Germany, Yokota Air Force base in Japan, and numerous military and non-military locations within the United States.\nBoth Turmoil and XKeyscore feed selected data to real-time \"tipping\" programs, such as Trafficthief, which can both alert NSA analysts when their targets are communicating and trigger other software programs. Selected data is \"promoted\" from the local XKeyscore data store to the NSA's so-called \"corporate repositories\" for long term storage, analysis and exploitation.\n<strong>More information about XKeyscore</strong>\nIn 2013, the British newspaper The Guardian revealed that by 2008 more than 150 internet surveillance facilities around the world were running the XKeyscore Deep Packet Inspection software. All of the internet traffic observed by XKeyscore, both metadata and full content, is analyzed and stored temporarily at the collection sites for periods ranging from days to weeks, while selected data is forwarded on to other locations for long-term storage.\nThe storage, indexing, and querying functions are performed at or near the collection sites because the volume of data being collected is too large to forward everything back to facilities in other countries. Analysts working from various locations around the world may search specific XKeyscore sites, or send their queries to a collection of sites.\nXKeyscore provides a modular architecture in which tens of thousands of small computer programs, or rules, written in XKeyscore's specialized programming languages called Genesis and XKScript as well as general-purpose languages such as C++ and Python, are run against all traffic to categorize it and extract data. This indexing of the \"full take\" allows analysts to query the temporary storage stored at the XKeyscore site, effectively sifting through already pilfered communications which occurred before they had deemed them interesting for a specific reason. XKeyscore can be fed by several different programs, including Wealthycluster and Turmoil.\nThese programs \"sessionize\" the data, which means that individual connections, such as a request for a web page, are reconstructed from the stream of intercepted packets.\nLocations where the NSA runs XKeyscore include Special Source Operations (SSO) sites, typically found at or near major telecommunication providers' infrastructure; Special Collection Service (SCS) sites, usually located inside diplomatic facilities like embassies and consulates; and FORNSAT sites where satellite communications are intercepted. All of these types of sites are known to exist in Germany.\nOther \"Five Eyes\" partners also operate XKeyscore installations. The United Kingdom's Tempora program runs the largest instance of XKeyscore. Both the software itself and limited access to NSA databases have been shared with so-called \"3rd party\" partners including Germany. The German foreign intelligence agency BND and the domestic intelligence agency BfV are testing the Software.</blockquote>\n</div>",

The breach, detailed in a secret 2010 GCHQ document, [1] gave the surveillance agencies the potential to secretly monitor a large portion of the world's cellular communications, including both voice and data.\nThe company targeted by the intelligence agencies, Gemalto, [2] is a multinational firm incorporated in the Netherlands that makes the chips used in mobile phones and next-generation credit cards. Among its clients are AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint and some 450 wireless network providers around the world. The company operates in 85 countries and has more than 40 manufacturing facilities. One of its three global headquarters is in Austin, Texas and it has a large factory in Pennsylvania.\nIn all, Gemalto produces some 2 billion SIM cards a year. Its motto is \"Security to be Free.\"\nWith these stolen encryption keys, intelligence agencies can monitor mobile communications without seeking or receiving approval from telecom companies and foreign governments. Possessing the keys also sidesteps the need to get a warrant or a wiretap, while leaving no trace on the wireless provider's network that the communications were intercepted. Bulk key theft additionally enables the intelligence agencies to unlock any previously encrypted communications they had already intercepted, but did not yet have the ability to decrypt.\nAs part of the covert operations against Gemalto, spies from GCHQ -- with support from the NSA -- mined the private communications of unwitting engineers and other company employees in multiple countries.\nGemalto was totally oblivious to the penetration of its systems -- and the spying on its employees. \"I'm disturbed, quite concerned that this has happened,\" Paul Beverly, a Gemalto executive vice president, told The Intercept. \"The most important thing for me is to understand exactly how this was done, so we can take every measure to ensure that it doesn't happen again, and also to make sure that there's no impact on the telecom operators that we have served in a very trusted manner for many years. What I want to understand is what sort of ramifications it has, or could have, on any of our customers.\" He added that \"the most important thing for us now is to understand the degree\" of the breach.\nLeading privacy advocates and security experts say that the theft of encryption keys from major wireless network providers is tantamount to a thief obtaining the master ring of a building superintendent who holds the keys to every apartment. \"Once you have the keys, decrypting traffic is trivial,\" says Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The news of this key theft will send a shock wave through the security community.\"\nBeverly said that after being contacted by The Intercept, Gemalto's internal security team began on Wednesday to investigate how their system was penetrated and could find no trace of the hacks. When asked if the NSA or GCHQ had ever requested access to Gemalto-manufactured encryption keys, Beverly said, \"I am totally unaware. To the best of my knowledge, no.\"\nAccording to one secret GCHQ slide, [3] the British intelligence agency penetrated Gemalto's internal networks, planting malware on several computers, giving GCHQ secret access. We \"believe we have their entire network,\" the slide's author boasted about the operation against Gemalto.\nAdditionally, the spy agency targeted unnamed cellular companies' core networks, giving it access to \"sales staff machines for customer information and network engineers machines for network maps.\" GCHQ also claimed the ability to manipulate the billing servers of cell companies to \"suppress\" charges in an effort to conceal the spy agency's secret actions against an individual's phone. Most significantly, GCHQ also penetrated \"authentication servers,\" allowing it to decrypt data and voice communications between a targeted individual's phone and his or her telecom provider's network. A note accompanying the slide asserted that the spy agency was \"very happy with the data so far and [was] working through the vast quantity of product.\"\nThe Mobile Handset Exploitation Team (MHET), whose existence has never before been disclosed, was formed in April 2010 to target vulnerabilities in cellphones. One of its main missions was to covertly penetrate computer networks of corporations that manufacture SIM cards, as well as those of wireless network providers. The team included operatives from both GCHQ and the NSA.\nWhile the FBI and other U.S. agencies can obtain court orders compelling U.S.-based telecom companies to allow them to wiretap or intercept the communications of their customers, on the international front this type of data collection is much more challenging. Unless a foreign telecom or foreign government grants access to their citizens' data to a U.S. intelligence agency, the NSA or CIA would have to hack into the network or specifically target the user's device for a more risky \"active\" form of surveillance that could be detected by sophisticated targets. Moreover, foreign intelligence agencies would not allow U.S. or U.K. spy agencies access to the mobile communications of their heads of state or other government officials.\n\"It's unbelievable. Unbelievable,\" said Gerard Schouw, a member of the Dutch Parliament, when told of the spy agencies' actions. Schouw, the intelligence spokesperson for D66, the largest opposition party in the Netherlands, told The Intercept, \"We don't want to have the secret services from other countries doing things like this.\" Schouw added that he and other lawmakers will ask the Dutch government to provide an official explanation and to clarify whether the country's intelligence services were aware of the targeting of Gemalto, whose official headquarters is in Amsterdam.\nLast November, the Dutch government proposed [4] an amendment to its constitution to include explicit protection for the privacy of digital communications, including those made on mobile devices. \"We have, in the Netherlands, a law on the [activities] of secret services. And hacking is not allowed,\" Schouw said. Under Dutch law, the interior minister would have to sign off on such operations by foreign governments' intelligence agencies. \"I don't believe that he has given his permission for these kind of actions.\"\nThe U.S. and British intelligence agencies pulled off the encryption key heist in great stealth, giving them the ability to intercept and decrypt communications without alerting the wireless network provider, the foreign government or the individual user that they have been targeted. \"Gaining access to a database of keys is pretty much game over for cellular encryption,\" says Matthew Green, a cryptography specialist at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute. The massive key theft is \"bad news for phone security. Really bad news.\"\nAS CONSUMERS BEGAN to adopt cellular phones en masse in the mid-1990s, there were no effective privacy protections in place. Anyone could buy a cheap device from RadioShack capable of intercepting calls placed on mobile phones. The shift from analog to digital networks introduced basic encryption technology, though it was still crackable by tech savvy computer science graduate students, as well as the FBI and other law enforcement agencies, using readily available equipment.\nToday, second-generation (2G) phone technology, which relies on a deeply flawed encryption system, remains the dominant platform globally, though U.S. and European cellphone companies now use 3G, 4G and LTE technology in urban areas. These include more secure, though not invincible, methods of encryption, and wireless carriers throughout the world are upgrading their networks to use these newer technologies.\nIt is in the context of such growing technical challenges to data collection that intelligence agencies, such as the NSA, have become interested in acquiring cellular encryption keys. \"With old-fashioned [2G], there are other ways to work around cellphone security without those keys,\" says Green, the Johns Hopkins cryptographer. \"With newer 3G, 4G and LTE protocols, however, the algorithms aren't as vulnerable, so getting those keys would be essential.\"\nThe privacy of all mobile communications -- voice calls, text messages and Internet access -- depends on an encrypted connection between the cellphone and the wireless carrier's network, using keys stored on the SIM, a tiny chip smaller than a postage stamp, which is inserted into the phone. All mobile communications on the phone depend on the SIM, which stores and guards the encryption keys created by companies like Gemalto. SIM cards can be used to store contacts, text messages, and other important data, like one's phone number. In some countries, SIM cards are used to transfer money. As The Intercept reported [5] last year, having the wrong SIM card can make you the target of a drone strike.\nSIM cards were not invented to protect individual communications -- they were designed to do something much simpler: ensure proper billing and prevent fraud, which was pervasive in the early days of cellphones. Soghoian compares the use of encryption keys on SIM cards to the way Social Security numbers are used today. \"Social security numbers were designed in the 1930s to track your contributions to your government pension,\" he says. \"Today they are used as a quasi national identity number, which was never their intended purpose.\"\nBecause the SIM card wasn't created with call confidentiality in mind, the manufacturers and wireless carriers don't make a great effort to secure their supply chain. As a result, the SIM card is an extremely vulnerable component of a mobile phone. \"I doubt anyone is treating those things very carefully,\" says Green. \"Cell companies probably don't treat them as essential security tokens. They probably just care that nobody is defrauding their networks.\" The ACLU's Soghoian adds, \"These keys are so valuable that it makes sense for intel agencies to go after them.\"\nAs a general rule, phone companies do not manufacture SIM cards, nor program them with secret encryption keys. It is cheaper and more efficient for them to outsource this sensitive step in the SIM card production process. They purchase them in bulk with the keys pre-loaded by other corporations. Gemalto is the largest of these SIM \"personalization\" companies.\nAfter a SIM card is manufactured, the encryption key, known as a \"Ki,\" is burned directly onto the chip. A copy of the key is also given to the cellular provider, allowing its network to recognize an individual's phone. In order for the phone to be able to connect to the wireless carrier's network, the phone -- with the help of the SIM -- authenticates itself using the Ki that has been programmed onto the SIM. The phone conducts a secret \"handshake\" that validates that the Ki on the SIM matches the Ki held by the mobile company. Once that happens, the communications between the phone and the network are encrypted. Even if GCHQ or the NSA were to intercept the phone signals as they are transmitted through the air, the intercepted data would be a garbled mess. Decrypting it can be challenging and time-consuming. Stealing the keys, on the other hand, is beautifully simple, from the intelligence agencies' point of view, as the pipeline for producing and distributing SIM cards was never designed to thwart mass surveillance efforts.\nOne of the creators of the encryption protocol that is widely used today for securing emails, Adi Shamir, famously asserted: \"Cryptography is typically bypassed, not penetrated.\" In other words, it is much easier (and sneakier) to open a locked door when you have the key than it is to break down the door using brute force. While the NSA and GCHQ have substantial resources dedicated to breaking encryption, it is not the only way -- and certainly not always the most efficient -- to get at the data they want. \"NSA has more mathematicians on its payroll than any other entity in the U.S.,\" says the ACLU's Soghoian. \"But the NSA's hackers are way busier than its mathematicians.\"\nGCHQ and the NSA could have taken any number of routes to steal SIM encryption keys and other data. They could have physically broken into a manufacturing plant. They could have broken into a wireless carrier's office. They could have bribed, blackmailed or coerced an employee of the manufacturer or cellphone provider. But all of that comes with substantial risk of exposure. In the case of Gemalto, hackers working for GCHQ remotely penetrated the company's computer network in order to steal the keys in bulk as they were en route to the wireless network providers.\nSIM card \"personalization\" companies like Gemalto ship hundreds of thousands of SIM cards at a time to mobile phone operators across the world. International shipping records obtained by The Intercept show that in 2011, Gemalto shipped 450,000 smart cards from its plant in Mexico to Germany's Deutsche Telekom in just one shipment.\nIn order for the cards to work and for the phones' communications to be secure, Gemalto also needs to provide the mobile company with a file containing the encryption keys for each of the new SIM cards. These master key files could be shipped via FedEx, DHL, UPS or another snail mail provider. More commonly, they could be sent via email or through File Transfer Protocol, FTP, a method of sending files over the Internet.\nThe moment the master key set is generated by Gemalto or another personalization company, but before it is sent to the wireless carrier, is the most vulnerable moment for interception. \"The value of getting them at the point of manufacture is you can presumably get a lot of keys in one go, since SIM chips get made in big batches,\" says Green, the cryptographer. \"SIM cards get made for lots of different carriers in one facility.\" In Gemalto's case, GCHQ hit the jackpot, as the company manufactures SIMs for hundreds of wireless network providers, including all of the leading U.S.-- and many of the largest European -- companies.\nBut obtaining the encryption keys while Gemalto still held them required finding a way into the company's internal systems.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2015/key-slide-540x351.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 351px;\"/>\n<em>Diagram from a top-secret GCHQ slide.</em><br/>\n<br/>TOP-SECRET GCHQ documents reveal that the intelligence agencies accessed the email and Facebook accounts of engineers and other employees of major telecom corporations and SIM card manufacturers in an effort to secretly obtain information that could give them access to millions of encryption keys. They did this by utilizing the NSA's X-KEYSCORE program, which allowed them access to private emails hosted by the SIM card and mobile companies' servers, as well as those of major tech corporations, including Yahoo and Google.\nIn effect, GCHQ clandestinely cyberstalked [6] Gemalto employees, scouring their emails in an effort to find people who may have had access to the company's core networks and Ki-generating systems. The intelligence agency's goal was to find information that would aid in breaching Gemalto's systems, making it possible to steal large quantities of encryption keys. The agency hoped to intercept the files containing the keys as they were transmitted between Gemalto and its wireless network provider customers.\nGCHQ operatives identified key individuals and their positions within Gemalto and then dug into their emails. In one instance, GCHQ zeroed in on a Gemalto employee in Thailand who they observed sending PGP-encrypted files, noting that if GCHQ wanted to expand its Gemalto operations, \"he would certainly be a good place to start.\" They did not claim to have decrypted the employee's communications, but noted that the use of PGP could mean the contents were potentially valuable.\nThe cyberstalking was not limited to Gemalto. GCHQ operatives wrote a script that allowed the agency to mine the private communications of employees of major telecommunications and SIM \"personalization\" companies for technical terms used in the assigning of secret keys to mobile phone customers. Employees for the SIM card manufacturers and wireless network providers were labeled as \"known individuals and operators targeted\" in a top-secret GCHQ document.\nAccording to that April 2010 document, [7] \"PCS Harvesting at Scale,\" hackers working for GCHQ focused on \"harvesting\" massive amounts of individual encryption keys \"in transit between mobile network operators and SIM card personalisation centres\" like Gemalto. The spies \"developed a methodology for intercepting these keys as they are transferred between various network operators and SIM card providers.\" By that time, GCHQ had developed \"an automated technique with the aim of increasing the volume of keys that can be harvested.\"\nThe PCS Harvesting document acknowledged that, in searching for information on encryption keys, GCHQ operatives would undoubtedly vacuum up \"a large number of unrelated items\" from the private communications of targeted employees. \"[H]owever an analyst with good knowledge of the operators involved can perform this trawl regularly and spot the transfer of large batches of [keys].\"\nThe document noted that many SIM card manufacturers transferred the encryption keys to wireless network providers \"by email or FTP with simple encryption methods that can be broken ... or occasionally with no encryption at all.\" To get bulk access to encryption keys, all the NSA or GCHQ needed to do was intercept emails or file transfers as they were sent over the Internet -- something both agencies already do millions of times per day. A footnote in the 2010 document observed that the use of \"strong encryption products ... is becoming increasingly common\" in transferring the keys.\nIn its key harvesting \"trial\" operations in the first quarter of 2010, GCHQ successfully intercepted [8] keys used by wireless network providers in Iran, Afghanistan, Yemen, India, Serbia, Iceland and Tajikistan. But, the agency noted, its automated key harvesting system failed to produce results against Pakistani networks, denoted as \"priority targets\" in the document, despite the fact that GCHQ had a store of Kis from two providers in the country, Mobilink and Telenor. \"[I]t is possible that these networks now use more secure methods to transfer Kis,\" the document concluded.\nFrom December 2009 through March 2010, a month before the Mobile Handset Exploitation Team was formed, GCHQ conducted a number of trials aimed at extracting encryption keys and other personalized data for individual phones. In one two-week period, they accessed the emails of 130 people associated with wireless network providers or SIM card manufacturing and personalization. This operation produced nearly 8,000 keys matched to specific phones in 10 countries. In another two-week period, by mining just six email addresses, they produced 85,000 keys. At one point in March 2010, GCHQ intercepted nearly 100,000 keys for mobile phone users in Somalia. By June, they'd compiled [9] 300,000. \"Somali providers are not on GCHQ's list of interest,\" the document noted. \"[H]owever, this was usefully shared with NSA.\"\nThe GCHQ documents only contain statistics for three months of encryption key theft in 2010. During this period, millions of keys were harvested. The documents stated explicitly that GCHQ had already created a constantly evolving automated process for bulk harvesting of keys. They describe active operations targeting Gemalto's personalization centers across the globe, as well as other major SIM card manufacturers and the private communications of their employees.\nA top-secret NSA document asserted that, as of 2009, the U.S. spy agency already had the capacity to process between 12 and 22 million keys per second for later use against surveillance targets. In the future, the agency predicted, it would be capable of processing more than 50 million per second. The document did not state how many keys were actually processed, just that the NSA had the technology to perform such swift, bulk operations. It is impossible to know how many keys have been stolen by the NSA and GCHQ to date, but, even using conservative math, the numbers are likely staggering.\nGCHQ assigned \"scores\" to more than 150 individual email addresses based on how often the users mentioned certain technical terms, and then intensified the mining of those individuals' accounts based on priority. The highest-scoring email address was that of an employee of Chinese tech giant Huawei, which the U.S. has repeatedly accused of collaborating with Chinese intelligence. In all, GCHQ harvested the emails of employees of hardware companies that manufacture phones, such as Ericsson and Nokia; operators of mobile networks, such as MTN Irancell and Belgacom; SIM card providers, such as Bluefish and Gemalto; and employees of targeted companies who used email providers, such as Yahoo and Google. During the three-month trial, the largest number of email addresses harvested were those belonging to Huawei employees, followed by MTN Irancell. The third largest class of emails harvested in the trial were private Gmail accounts, presumably belonging to employees at targeted companies.\nThe GCHQ program targeting Gemalto was called DAPINO GAMMA. In 2011, GCHQ launched operation HIGHLAND FLING to mine the email accounts of Gemalto employees in France and Poland. A top-secret document on the operation stated that one of the aims was \"getting into French HQ\" of Gemalto \"to get in to core data repositories.\" France, home to one of Gemalto's global headquarters, is the nerve center of the company's worldwide operations. Another goal was to intercept private communications of employees in Poland that \"could lead to penetration into one or more personalisation centers\" -- the factories where the encryption keys are burned onto SIM cards.\nAs part of these operations, GCHQ operatives acquired the usernames and passwords for Facebook accounts of Gemalto targets. An internal top-secret GCHQ wiki on the program from May 2011 indicated that GCHQ was in the process of \"targeting\" more than a dozen Gemalto facilities across the globe, including in Germany, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, China, India, Italy, Russia, Sweden, Spain, Japan and Singapore.\nThe document also stated that GCHQ was preparing similar key theft operations against one of Gemalto's competitors, Germany-based SIM card giant Giesecke and Devrient.\nOn January 17, 2014, President Barack Obama gave a major address on the NSA spying scandal. \"The bottom line is that people around the world, regardless of their nationality, should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don't threaten our national security and that we take their privacy concerns into account in our policies and procedures,\" he said.\nThe monitoring of the lawful communications of employees of major international corporations shows that such statements by Obama, other U.S. officials and British leaders -- that they only intercept and monitor the communications of known or suspected criminals or terrorists -- were untrue. \"The NSA and GCHQ view the private communications of people who work for these companies as fair game,\" says the ACLU's Soghoian. \"These people were specifically hunted and targeted by intelligence agencies, not because they did anything wrong, but because they could be used as a means to an end.\"\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"491\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2015/key-slide2.png\" width=\"900\"/>\nTHERE ARE TWO basic types of electronic or digital surveillance: passive and active. All intelligence agencies engage in extensive passive surveillance, which means they collect bulk data by intercepting communications sent over fiber-optic cables, radio waves or wireless devices.\nIntelligence agencies place high-power antennas, known as \"spy nests,\" on the top of their countries' embassies and consulates, which are capable of vacuuming up data sent to or from mobile phones in the surrounding area. The joint NSA/CIA Special Collection Service is the lead entity that installs and mans these nests for the United States. An embassy situated near a parliament or government agency could easily intercept the phone calls and data transfers of the mobile phones used by foreign government officials. The U.S. embassy in Berlin, for instance, is located a stone's throw from the Bundestag. But if the wireless carriers are using stronger encryption, which is built into modern 3G, 4G and LTE networks, then intercepted calls and other data would be more difficult to crack, particularly in bulk. If the intelligence agency wants to actually listen to or read what is being transmitted, they would need to decrypt the encrypted data.\nActive surveillance is another option. This would require government agencies to \"jam\" a 3G or 4G network, forcing nearby phones onto 2G. Once forced down to the less secure 2G technology, the phone can be tricked into connecting to a fake cell tower operated by an intelligence agency. This method of surveillance, though effective, is risky, as it leaves a digital trace that counter-surveillance experts from foreign governments could detect.\nStealing the Kis solves all of these problems. This way, intelligence agencies can safely engage in passive, bulk surveillance without having to decrypt data and without leaving any trace whatsoever.\n\"Key theft enables the bulk, low-risk surveillance of encrypted communications,\" the ACLU's Soghoian says. \"Agencies can collect all the communications and then look through them later. With the keys, they can decrypt whatever they want, whenever they want. It's like a time machine, enabling the surveillance of communications that occurred before someone was even a target.\"\nNeither the NSA nor GCHQ would comment specifically on the key theft operations. In the past, they have argued more broadly that breaking encryption is a necessary part of tracking terrorists and other criminals. \"It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters,\" a GCHQ official stated in an email, adding that the agency's work is conducted within a \"strict legal and policy framework\" that ensures its activities are \"authorized, necessary and proportionate,\" with proper oversight, which is the standard response the agency has provided for previous stories published by The Intercept. The agency also said, \"[T]he UK's interception regime is entirely compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.\" The NSA declined to offer any comment.\nIt is unlikely that GCHQ's pronouncement about the legality of its operations will be universally embraced in Europe. \"It is governments massively engaging in illegal activities,\" says Sophie in't Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament. \"If you are not a government and you are a student doing this, you will end up in jail for 30 years.\" Veld, who chaired the European Parliament's recent inquiry into mass surveillance exposed by Snowden, told The Intercept: \"The secret services are just behaving like cowboys. Governments are behaving like cowboys and nobody is holding them to account.\"\nThe Intercept's Laura Poitras has previously reported [10] that in 2013 Australia's signals intelligence agency, a close partner of the NSA, stole some 1.8 million encryption keys from an Indonesian wireless carrier.\nA few years ago, the FBI reportedly [11] dismantled several transmitters set up by foreign intelligence agencies around the Washington, D.C. area, which could be used to intercept cellphone communications. Russia, China, Israel and other nations use similar technology as the NSA across the world. If those governments had the encryption keys for major U.S. cellphone companies' customers, such as those manufactured by Gemalto, mass snooping would be simple. \"It would mean that with a few antennas placed around Washington, D.C., the Chinese or Russian governments could sweep up and decrypt the communications of members of Congress, U.S. agency heads, reporters, lobbyists and everyone else involved in the policymaking process and decrypt their telephone conversations,\" says Soghoian.\n\"Put a device in front of the U.N., record every bit you see going over the air. Steal some keys, you have all those conversations,\" says Green, the Johns Hopkins cryptographer. And it's not just spy agencies that would benefit from stealing encryption keys. \"I can only imagine how much money you could make if you had access to the calls made around Wall Street,\" he adds.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/covert-operations/2015/gemalto-slide-540x404.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 404px;\"/>\n<em>GCHQ slide.</em><br/>\n<br/>THE BREACH OF Gemalto's computer network by GCHQ has far-reaching global implications. The company, which brought in $2.7 billion in revenue in 2013, is a global leader in digital security, producing banking cards, mobile payment systems, two-factor authentication devices used for online security, hardware tokens used for securing buildings and offices, electronic passports and identification cards. It provides chips to Vodafone in Europe and France's Orange, as well as EE, a joint venture in the U.K. between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom. Royal KPN, the largest Dutch wireless network provider, also uses Gemalto technology.\nIn Asia, Gemalto's chips are used by China Unicom, Japan's NTT and Taiwan's Chungwa Telecom, as well as scores of wireless network providers throughout Africa and the Middle East. The company's security technology is used by more than 3,000 financial institutions and 80 government organizations. Among its clients are Visa, Mastercard, American Express, JP Morgan Chase and Barclays. It also provides chips for use in luxury cars, including those made by Audi and BMW.\nIn 2012, Gemalto won a sizable contract, worth $175 million, from the U.S. government to produce the covers for electronic U.S. passports, which contain chips and antennas that can be used to better authenticate travelers. As part of its contract, Gemalto provides the personalization and software for the microchips implanted in the passports. The U.S. represents Gemalto's single largest market, accounting for some 15 percent of its total business. This raises the question of whether GCHQ, which was able to bypass encryption on mobile networks, has the ability to access private data protected by other Gemalto products created for banks and governments.\nAs smart phones become smarter, they are increasingly replacing credit cards and cash as a means of paying for goods and services. When Verizon, AT&amp;T and T-Mobile formed an alliance in 2010 to jointly build an electronic pay system to challenge Google Wallet and Apple Pay, they purchased Gemalto's technology for their program, known as Softcard. (Until July 2014, it previously went by the unfortunate name of \"ISIS Mobile Wallet.\") Whether data relating to that, and other Gemalto security products, has been compromised by GCHQ and the NSA is unclear. Both intelligence agencies declined to answer any specific questions for this story.\nPRIVACY ADVOCATES and security experts say it would take billions of dollars, significant political pressure, and several years to fix the fundamental security flaws in the current mobile phone system that NSA, GCHQ and other intelligence agencies regularly exploit.\nA current gaping hole in the protection of mobile communications is that cellphones and wireless network providers do not support the use of Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), a form of encryption designed to limit the damage caused by theft or disclosure of encryption keys. PFS, which is now built into modern web browsers and used by sites like Google and Twitter, works by generating unique encryption keys for each communication or message, which are then discarded. Rather than using the same encryption key to protect years' worth of data, as the permanent Kis on SIM cards can, a new key might be generated each minute, hour or day, and then promptly destroyed. Because cellphone communications do not utilize PFS, if an intelligence agency has been \"passively\" intercepting someone's communications for a year and later acquires the permanent encryption key, it can go back and decrypt all of those communications. If mobile phone networks were using PFS, that would not be possible -- even if the permanent keys were later stolen.\nThe only effective way for individuals to protect themselves from Ki theft-enabled surveillance is to use secure communications software, rather than relying on SIM card-based security. Secure software includes email and other apps that use Transport Layer Security (TLS), the mechanism underlying the secure HTTPS web protocol. The email clients included with Android phones and iPhones support TLS, as do large email providers like Yahoo and Google.\nApps like TextSecure and Silent Text are secure alternatives to SMS messages, while Signal, RedPhone and Silent Phone encrypt voice calls. Governments still may be able to intercept communications, but reading or listening to them would require hacking a specific handset, obtaining internal data from an email provider, or installing a bug in a room to record the conversations.\n\"We need to stop assuming that the phone companies will provide us with a secure method of making calls or exchanging text messages,\" says Soghoian.\n<em>Documents published with this article:</em>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/cne-access-core-mobile-networks-2/\"><strong>CNE Access to Core Mobile Networks</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/keys/\"><strong>Where Are These Keys?</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-successes-jan10-mar10-trial/\"><strong>CCNE Successes Jan10-Mar10 Trial</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/dapino-gamma-cne-presence-wiki/\"><strong>DAPINO GAMMA CNE Presence Wiki</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/dapino-gamma-gemalto-yuaawaa-wiki/\"><strong>DAPINO GAMMA Gemalto Yuaawaa Wiki</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <strong><a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/dapino-gamma-target-personalisation-centres-gemalto-wiki/\">DAPINO GAMMA Target Personalisation Centres Gemalto Wiki</a></strong><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/imsis-identified-ki-data-network-providers-jan10-mar10-trial/\"><strong>IMSIs Identified with Ki Data for Network Providers Jan10-Mar10 Trial</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-stats-summaries-jan10-mar10-trial/\"><strong>CCNE Stats Summaries Jan10-Mar10 Trial</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-email-harvesting-jan10-mar10-trial/\"><strong>CCNE Email Harvesting Jan10-Mar10 Trial</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/ccne-email-addresses-jan10-mar10-trial/\"><strong>CCNE Email Addresses Jan10-Mar10 Trial</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\n* <a href=\"https://firstlook.org/theintercept/document/2015/02/19/pcs-harvesting-scale/\"><strong>PCS Harvesting at Scale</strong></a><br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional reporting by Andrew Fishman and Ryan Gallagher.

The German newsweekly did not write about the BADASS document, attaching it to a broader article [2] on cyberwarfare. According to The Intercept's analysis of the document, intelligence agents applied BADASS software filters to streams of intercepted internet traffic, plucking from that traffic unencrypted uploads from smartphones to servers run by advertising and analytics companies.\nProgrammers frequently embed code from a handful of such companies into their smartphone apps because it helps them answer a variety of questions: How often does a particular user open the app, and at what time of day? Where does the user live? Where does the user work? Where is the user right now? What's the phone's unique identifier? What version of Android or iOS is the device running? What's the user's IP address? Answers to those questions guide app upgrades and help target advertisements, benefits that help explain why tracking users is not only routine in the tech industry but also considered a best practice.\nFor users, however, the smartphone data routinely provided to ad and analytics companies represents a major privacy threat. When combined together, the information fragments can be used to identify specific users, and when concentrated in the hands of a small number of companies, they have proven to be irresistibly convenient targets for those engaged in mass surveillance. Although the BADASS presentation appears to be roughly four years old, at least one player in the mobile advertising and analytics space, Google, acknowledges that its servers still routinely receive unencrypted uploads from Google code embedded in apps.\nFor spy agencies, this smartphone monitoring data represented a new, convenient way of learning more about surveillance targets, including information about their physical movements and digital activities. It also would have made it possible to design more focused cyberattacks against those people, for example by exploiting a weakness in a particular app known to be used by a particular person. Such scenarios are strongly hinted at in a 2010 NSA presentation, [3] provided by agency whistleblower Edward Snowden and published last year in The New York Times, Pro Publica, and The Guardian. That presentation stated that smartphone monitoring would be useful because it could lead to \"additional exploitation\" and the unearthing of \"target knowledge/leads, location, [and] target technology.\"\nThe 2010 presentation, along with additional documents from Britain's intelligence service Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, showed that the intelligence agencies were aggressively ramping up their efforts to see into the world of mobile apps. But the specifics of how they might distill useful information from the torrent of internet packets to and from smartphones remained unclear.\n<strong>Encrypting Data in Transit</strong>\nThe BADASS slides fill in some of these blanks. They appear to have been presented in 2011 at the highly secretive SIGDEV intelligence community conference. The presentation states that \"analytics firm Flurry estimates that 250,000 Motorola Droid phones were sold in the United States during the phone's first week in stores,\" and asks, \"how do they know that?\"\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"675\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass1-1000x750.png\" width=\"900\"/>\nThe answer is that during the week in question, Flurry uploaded to its own servers analytics from Droid phones on behalf of app developers, one phone at a time, and stored the analytics in their own databases. Analytics includes any information that is available to the app and that can conceivably help improve it, including, in certain instances with Flurry, the user's age and gender, physical location, how long they left the app open, and a unique identifier for the phone, according to Flurry materials included in the BADASS document.\nBy searching these databases, the company was able to get a count of Droid phones running Flurry-enabled apps and, by extrapolating, estimate the total number of Droids in circulation. The company can find similar information about any smartphone that their analytics product supports.\nNot only was Flurry vacuuming sensitive data up to its servers, it was doing so insecurely. When a smartphone app collects data about the device it's running on and sends it back to a tracking company, it generally uses the HTTP protocol, and Flurry-enabled apps were no exception. But HTTP is inherently insecure--eavesdroppers can easily spy on the entire digital conversation.\nIf the tracking data was always phoned home using the HTTPS protocol--the same as the HTTP protocol, except that the stream of traffic between the phone and the server is encrypted--then the ability for spy agencies to collect tracking data with programs like BADASS would be severely impeded.\nYahoo, which acquired the analytics firm Flurry in late 2014, says that since acquiring the company they have \"implemented default encryption between Flurry-enabled applications and Flurry servers. The 2010 report in question does not apply to current versions of Flurry's analytics product.\" Given that Yahoo acquired Flurry so recently, it's unclear how many apps still use Flurry's older tracking code that sends unencrypted data back to Yahoo's servers. (Yahoo declined to elaborate specifically on that topic.)\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass10-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/>\nThe BADASS slides also use Google's advertisement network AdMob as an example of intercepted, unencrypted data. Free smartphone apps are often supported by ads, and if the app uses AdMob then it sends some identifying information to AdMob's servers while loading the ad. Google currently supports the ability for app developers to turn on HTTPS for ad requests, [4] however it's clear that only some AdMob users actually do this.\nWhen asked about HTTPS support for AdMob, a Google spokesperson said, \"We continue our ongoing efforts to encrypt all Google products and services.\"\nIn addition to Yahoo's Flurry and Google's AdMob, the BADASS presentation also shows that British and Canadian intelligence were targeting Mobclix, Mydas, Medialets, and MSN Mobile Advertising. But it's clear that any mobile-related plaintext traffic from any company is a potential target. While the BADASS presentation focuses on traffic from analytics and ad companies, it also shows spying on Google Maps heartbeat traffic, and capturing \"beacons\" sent out when apps are first opened (listing Qriously, Com2Us, Fluentmobile, and Papayamobile as examples). The BADASS presentation also mentions capturing GPS coordinates that get leaked when opening BlackBerry's app store.\nIn a boilerplate statement, GCHQ said, \"It is longstanding policy that we do not comment on intelligence matters. Furthermore, all of GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensures that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight.\" Its Canadian counterpart, Communications Security Establishment Canada, or CSEC, responded with a statement that read, in part, \"For reasons of national security, CSE cannot comment on its methods, techniques or capabilities. CSE conducts foreign intelligence and cyber defence activities in compliance with Canadian law.\"\nJulia Angwin, who has doggedly investigated online privacy issues as a journalist and author, most recently of the book \"Dragnet Nation,\" explains that \"every type of unique identifier that passes [over the internet] unencrypted is giving away information about users to anyone who wants it,\" and that \"the evidence is clear that it's very risky to be throwing unique identifiers out there in the clear. Anyone can grab them. This is more evidence that no one should be doing that.\"\n<strong>Building Haystacks to Search for Needles</strong>\nThe BADASS program was created not merely to track advertising and analytic data but to solve a much bigger problem: There is an overwhelming amount of smartphone tracking data being collected by intelligence agencies, and it's difficult to make sense of.\nFirst there are the major platforms: iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and BlackBerry. On each platform, a range of hardware and platform versions are in use. Additionally, app stores are overflowing; new apps that track people get released every day. Old apps constantly get updated to track people in different ways, and people use different versions of apps for different platforms all at once. Adding to the diversity, there are several different ad and analytics companies that app developers use, and when those companies send tracking data back to their servers, they use a wide variety of formats.\nWith such an unwieldy haystack of data, GCHQ and CSEC, started the BADASS program, according to the presentation, to find the needles: information that can uniquely identify people and their devices, such as smartphone identifiers, tracking cookies, and other unique strings, as well as personally identifying information like GPS coordinates and email addresses.\nBADASS is an an acryonym that stands for BEGAL Automated Deployment And Survey System. (It is not clear what \"BEGAL\" stands for, in turn.) The slideshow presentation is called \"Mobile apps doubleheader: BADASS Angry Birds,\" and promises \"protocols exploitation in a rapidly changing world.\"\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass2-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/>\n<strong>Exploiting Protocols in a Rapidly Changing World</strong>\nAnalysts are able to write BADASS \"rules\" that look for specific types of tracking information as it travels across the internet.\nFor example, when someone opens an app that loads an ad, their phone normally sends an unencrypted web request (called an HTTP request) to the ad network's servers. If this request gets intercepted by spy agencies and fed into the BADASS program, it then gets filtered through each rule to see if one applies to the request. If it finds a match, BADASS can then automatically pull out the juicy information.\nIn the following slide, the information that is potentially available in a single HTTP request to load an ad includes which platform the ad is being loaded on (Android, iOS, etc.), the unique identifier of the device, the IMEI [5] number which cell towers use to identify phones that try to connect to them, the name and version of the operating system that's running, the model of the device, and latitude and longitude location data.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass3-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/>\nSimilar information is sent across the internet in HTTP requests in several different formats depending on what company it's being sent to, what device it's running on, and what version of the ad or analytics software is being used. Because this is constantly changing, analysts can write their own BADASS rules to capture all of the permutations they can find.\nThe following slide shows part of the BADASS user interface, and a partial list of rules.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass4-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/>\nThe slideshow includes a section called \"Abusing BADASS for Fun and Profit\" which goes into detail about the methodology analysts use to write new BADASS rules.<br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass5-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/><br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass6-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/><br/>\n<br/>By looking at intercepted HTTP traffic and writing rules to parse it, analysts can quickly gather as much information as possibly from leaky smartphone apps. One slide states: \"Creativity, iterative testing, domain knowledge, and the right tools can help us target multiple platforms in a very short time period.\"\n<strong>Privacy Policies That Don't Deliver</strong>\nThe slides also appear to mock the privacy promises of ad and analytics companies.\nCompanies that collect usage statistics about software often insist that the data is anonymous because they don't include identifying information such as names, phone numbers, and email addresses of the users that they're tracking. But in reality, sending unique device identifiers, IP addresses, IMEI numbers, and GPS coordinates of devices is far from anonymous. [6]\nIn one slide, the phrase \"anonymous usage statistics\" appears in conspicuous quotation marks. The spies are well aware that despite not including specific types of information, the data they collect from leaky smartphone apps is enough for them to uniquely identify their targets.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass7-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/>\nThe following slides show a chunk of Flurry's privacy policy (at this point it has been replaced by Yahoo's privacy policy), which states what information it collects from devices and how it believes this is anonymous.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass8-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/><br/>\n<br/><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/badass9-1000x750.png\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 675px;\"/><br/>\n<br/>The red box, which is present in the original slides, highlights this part: \"None of this information can identify the individual. No names, phone numbers, email addresses, or anything else considered personally identifiable information is ever collected.\"\nClearly the intelligence services disagree.\n\"Commercial surveillance often appears very benign,\" Angwin says. \"The reason Flurry exists is not to 'spy on people' but to help people learn who's using their apps. But what we've also seen through Snowden revelations is that spy agencies seek to use that for their own purposes.\"\n<strong>The Web has the Exact Same Problems</strong>\nWhile the BADASS program is specifically designed to target smartphone traffic, websites suffer from these exact same problems, and in many cases they're even worse.\nWebsites routinely include bits of tracking code from several different companies for ads, analytics, and other behavioral tracking. This, combined with the lack of HTTPS, turns your web browser into a surveillance device that follows you around, even if you switch networks or use proxy servers.\nIn other words, while the BADASS presentation may be four years old, and while it's been a year and a half since Snowden's leaks began educating technology companies and users about the massive privacy threats they face, the big privacy holes exploited by BADASS remain a huge problem.\n[1] <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35670.pdf\">http://www.spiegel.de/media/media-35670.pdf</a>\n[2] <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/new-snowden-docs-indicate-scope-of-nsa-preparations-for-cyber-battle-a-1013409.html\">http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/new-snowden-docs-indicate-scope-of-nsa-preparations-for-cyber-battle-a-1013409.html</a>\n[3] <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/28/world/28mobile-annotateA.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/01/28/world/28mobile-annotateA.html</a>\n[4] <a href=\"https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6110580?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3052727\">https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6110580?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=3052727</a>\n[5] <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Station_Equipment_Identity\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Mobile_Station_Equipment_Identity</a>\n[6] <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/primer-information-theory-and-privacy\">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/01/primer-information-theory-and-privacy</a>\n</div>",

Around the world, when a person gets online to do anything -- write an email, post to a social network, browse the web or play a video game -- there's a decent chance that the Internet traffic her device sends and receives is getting collected and processed by one of XKEYSCORE's hundreds of servers scattered across the globe.\nIn order to make sense of such a massive and steady flow of information, analysts working for the National Security Agency, as well as partner spy agencies, have written thousands of snippets of code to detect different types of traffic and extract useful information from each type, according to documents dating up to 2013. For example, the system automatically detects if a given piece of traffic is an email. If it is, the system tags if it's from Yahoo or Gmail, if it contains an airline itinerary, if it's encrypted with PGP, or if the sender's language is set to Arabic, along with myriad other details.\nThis global Internet surveillance network is powered by a somewhat clunky piece of software running on clusters of Linux servers. Analysts access XKEYSCORE's web interface to search its wealth of private information, similar to how ordinary people can search Google for public information.\nBased on documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, The Intercept is shedding light on the inner workings of XKEYSCORE, one of the most extensive programs of mass surveillance in human history.\n<strong>How XKEYSCORE works under the hood</strong>\nIt is tempting to assume that expensive, proprietary operating systems and software must power XKEYSCORE, but it actually relies on an entirely open source stack. In fact, according to an analysis of an XKEYSCORE manual for new systems administrators from the end of 2012, the system may have design deficiencies that could leave it vulnerable to attack by an intelligence agency insider.\nXKEYSCORE is a piece of Linux software that is typically deployed on Red Hat servers. It uses the Apache web server and stores collected data in MySQL databases. File systems in a cluster are handled by the NFS distributed file system and the autofs service, and scheduled tasks are handled by the cron scheduling service. Systems administrators who maintain XKEYSCORE servers use SSH to connect to them, and they use tools such as rsync and vim, as well as a comprehensive command-line tool, to manage the software.\nJohn Adams, former security lead and senior operations engineer for Twitter, says that one of the most interesting things about XKEYSCORE's architecture is \"that they were able to achieve so much success with such a poorly designed system. Data ingest, day-to-day operations, and searching is all poorly designed. There are many open source offerings that would function far better than this design with very little work. Their operations team must be extremely unhappy.\"\nAnalysts connect to XKEYSCORE over HTTPS using standard web browsers such as Firefox. Internet Explorer is not supported. Analysts can log into the system with either a user ID and password or by using public key authentication.\nAs of 2009, XKEYSCORE servers were located at more than 100 field sites all over the world. Each field site consists of a cluster of servers; the exact number differs depending on how much information is being collected at that site. Sites with relatively low traffic can get by with fewer servers, but sites that spy on larger amounts of traffic require more servers to filter and parse it all. XKEYSCORE has been engineered to scale in both processing power and storage by adding more servers to a cluster. According to a 2009 document, some field sites receive over 20 terrabytes of data per day. This is the equivalent of 5.7 million songs, or over 13 thousand full-length films.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-map-125-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\n<em>This map from a 2009 top-secret presentation does not show all of XKEYSCORE's field sites.</em>\nWhen data is collected at an XKEYSCORE field site, it is processed locally and ultimately stored in MySQL databases at that site. XKEYSCORE supports a federated query system, which means that an analyst can conduct a single query from the central XKEYSCORE website, and it will communicate over the Internet to all of the field sites, running the query everywhere at once.\nThere might be security issues with the XKEYSCORE system itself as well. As hard as software developers may try, it's nearly impossible to write bug-free source code. To compensate for this, developers often rely on multiple layers of security; if attackers can get through one layer, they may still be thwarted by other layers. XKEYSCORE appears to do a bad job of this.\nWhen systems administrators log into XKEYSCORE servers to configure them, they appear to use a shared account, under the name \"oper.\" Adams notes, \"That means that changes made by an administrator cannot be logged.\" If one administrator does something malicious on an XKEYSCORE server using the \"oper\" user, it's possible that the digital trail of what was done wouldn't lead back to the administrator, since multiple operators use the account.\nThere appears to be another way an ill-intentioned systems administrator may be able to cover their tracks. Analysts wishing to query XKEYSCORE sign in via a web browser, and their searches are logged. This creates an audit trail, on which the system relies to assure that users aren't doing overly broad searches that would pull up U.S. citizens' web traffic. Systems administrators, however, are able to run MySQL queries. The documents indicate that administrators have the ability to directly query the MySQL databases, where the collected data is stored, apparently bypassing the audit trail.\n<strong>AppIDs, fingerprints and microplugins</strong>\nCollecting massive amounts of raw data is not very useful unless it is collated and organized in a way that can be searched. To deal with this problem, XKEYSCORE extracts and tags metadata and content from the raw data so that analysts can easily search it.\nThis is done by using dictionaries of rules called appIDs, fingerprints and microplugins that are written in a custom programming language called GENESIS. Each of these can be identified by a unique name that resembles a directory tree, such as \"mail/webmail/gmail,\" \"chat/yahoo,\" or \"botnet/blackenergybot/command/flood.\"\nOne document detailing XKEYSCORE appIDs and fingerprints lists several revealing examples. Windows Update requests appear to fall under the \"update_service/windows\" appID, and normal web requests fall under the \"http/get\" appID. XKEYSCORE can automatically detect Airblue travel itineraries with the \"travel/airblue\" fingerprint, and iPhone web browser traffic with the \"browser/cellphone/iphone\" fingerprint.\nPGP-encrypted messages are detected with the \"encryption/pgp/message\" fingerprint, and messages encrypted with Mojahedeen Secrets 2 (a type of encryption popular among supporters of al Qaeda) are detected with the \"encryption/mojaheden2\" fingerprint.\nWhen new traffic flows into an XKEYSCORE cluster, the system tests the intercepted data against each of these rules and stores whether the traffic matches the pattern. A slideshow presentation from 2010 says that XKEYSCORE contains almost 10,000 appIDs and fingerprints.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-app-for-that-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nAppIDs are used to identify the protocol of traffic being intercepted, while fingerprints detect a specific type of content. Each intercepted stream of traffic gets assigned up to one appID and any number of fingerprints. You can think of appIDs as categories and fingerprints as tags.\nIf multiple appIDs match a single stream of traffic, the appID with the lowest \"level\" is selected (appIDs with lower levels are more specific than appIDs with higher levels). For example, when XKEYSCORE is assessing a file attachment from Yahoo mail, all of the appIDs in the following slide will apply, however only \"mail/webmail/yahoo/attachment\" will be associated with this stream of traffic.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-appids-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nTo tie it all together, when an Arabic speaker logs into a Yahoo email address, XKEYSCORE will store \"mail/yahoo/login\" as the associated appID. This stream of traffic will match the \"mail/arabic\" fingerprint (denoting language settings), as well as the \"mail/yahoo/ymbm\" fingerprint (which detects Yahoo browser cookies).\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-appids-fingerprints-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nSometimes the GENESIS programming language, which largely relies on Boolean logic, regular expressions and a set of simple functions, isn't powerful enough to do the complex pattern-matching required to detect certain types of traffic. In these cases, as one slide puts it, \"Power users can drop in to C++ to express themselves.\" AppIDs or fingerprints that are written in C++ are called microplugins.\nHere's an example of a microplugin fingerprint for \"botnet/conficker_p2p_udp_data,\" which is tricky botnet traffic that can't be identified without complicated logic. A botnet is a collection of hacked computers, sometimes millions of them, that are controlled from a single point.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-conficker-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nHere's another microplugin that uses C++ to inspect intercepted Facebook chat messages and pull out details like the associated email address and body of the chat message.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-facebook-chat-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nOne document from 2009 describes in detail four generations of appIDs and fingerprints, which begin with only the ability to scan intercepted traffic for keywords, and end with the ability to write complex microplugins that can be deployed to field sites around the world in hours.\nIf XKEYSCORE development has continued at a similar pace over the last six years, it's likely considerably more powerful today.\nEmail the authors: micah.lee@theintercept.com, glenn.greenwald@theintercept.com, morgan@firstlook.org\n<em>Documents published with this

Around the world, when a person gets online to do anything -- write an email, post to a social network, browse the web or play a video game -- there's a decent chance that the Internet traffic her device sends and receives is getting collected and processed by one of XKEYSCORE's hundreds of servers scattered across the globe.\nIn order to make sense of such a massive and steady flow of information, analysts working for the National Security Agency, as well as partner spy agencies, have written thousands of snippets of code to detect different types of traffic and extract useful information from each type, according to documents dating up to 2013. For example, the system automatically detects if a given piece of traffic is an email. If it is, the system tags if it's from Yahoo or Gmail, if it contains an airline itinerary, if it's encrypted with PGP, or if the sender's language is set to Arabic, along with myriad other details.\nThis global Internet surveillance network is powered by a somewhat clunky piece of software running on clusters of Linux servers. Analysts access XKEYSCORE's web interface to search its wealth of private information, similar to how ordinary people can search Google for public information.\nBased on documents provided by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, The Intercept is shedding light on the inner workings of XKEYSCORE, one of the most extensive programs of mass surveillance in human history.\n<strong>How XKEYSCORE works under the hood</strong>\nIt is tempting to assume that expensive, proprietary operating systems and software must power XKEYSCORE, but it actually relies on an entirely open source stack. In fact, according to an analysis of an XKEYSCORE manual for new systems administrators from the end of 2012, the system may have design deficiencies that could leave it vulnerable to attack by an intelligence agency insider.\nXKEYSCORE is a piece of Linux software that is typically deployed on Red Hat servers. It uses the Apache web server and stores collected data in MySQL databases. File systems in a cluster are handled by the NFS distributed file system and the autofs service, and scheduled tasks are handled by the cron scheduling service. Systems administrators who maintain XKEYSCORE servers use SSH to connect to them, and they use tools such as rsync and vim, as well as a comprehensive command-line tool, to manage the software.\nJohn Adams, former security lead and senior operations engineer for Twitter, says that one of the most interesting things about XKEYSCORE's architecture is \"that they were able to achieve so much success with such a poorly designed system. Data ingest, day-to-day operations, and searching is all poorly designed. There are many open source offerings that would function far better than this design with very little work. Their operations team must be extremely unhappy.\"\nAnalysts connect to XKEYSCORE over HTTPS using standard web browsers such as Firefox. Internet Explorer is not supported. Analysts can log into the system with either a user ID and password or by using public key authentication.\nAs of 2009, XKEYSCORE servers were located at more than 100 field sites all over the world. Each field site consists of a cluster of servers; the exact number differs depending on how much information is being collected at that site. Sites with relatively low traffic can get by with fewer servers, but sites that spy on larger amounts of traffic require more servers to filter and parse it all. XKEYSCORE has been engineered to scale in both processing power and storage by adding more servers to a cluster. According to a 2009 document, some field sites receive over 20 terrabytes of data per day. This is the equivalent of 5.7 million songs, or over 13 thousand full-length films.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-map-125-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\n<em>This map from a 2009 top-secret presentation does not show all of XKEYSCORE's field sites.</em>\nWhen data is collected at an XKEYSCORE field site, it is processed locally and ultimately stored in MySQL databases at that site. XKEYSCORE supports a federated query system, which means that an analyst can conduct a single query from the central XKEYSCORE website, and it will communicate over the Internet to all of the field sites, running the query everywhere at once.\nThere might be security issues with the XKEYSCORE system itself as well. As hard as software developers may try, it's nearly impossible to write bug-free source code. To compensate for this, developers often rely on multiple layers of security; if attackers can get through one layer, they may still be thwarted by other layers. XKEYSCORE appears to do a bad job of this.\nWhen systems administrators log into XKEYSCORE servers to configure them, they appear to use a shared account, under the name \"oper.\" Adams notes, \"That means that changes made by an administrator cannot be logged.\" If one administrator does something malicious on an XKEYSCORE server using the \"oper\" user, it's possible that the digital trail of what was done wouldn't lead back to the administrator, since multiple operators use the account.\nThere appears to be another way an ill-intentioned systems administrator may be able to cover their tracks. Analysts wishing to query XKEYSCORE sign in via a web browser, and their searches are logged. This creates an audit trail, on which the system relies to assure that users aren't doing overly broad searches that would pull up U.S. citizens' web traffic. Systems administrators, however, are able to run MySQL queries. The documents indicate that administrators have the ability to directly query the MySQL databases, where the collected data is stored, apparently bypassing the audit trail.\n<strong>AppIDs, fingerprints and microplugins</strong>\nCollecting massive amounts of raw data is not very useful unless it is collated and organized in a way that can be searched. To deal with this problem, XKEYSCORE extracts and tags metadata and content from the raw data so that analysts can easily search it.\nThis is done by using dictionaries of rules called appIDs, fingerprints and microplugins that are written in a custom programming language called GENESIS. Each of these can be identified by a unique name that resembles a directory tree, such as \"mail/webmail/gmail,\" \"chat/yahoo,\" or \"botnet/blackenergybot/command/flood.\"\nOne document detailing XKEYSCORE appIDs and fingerprints lists several revealing examples. Windows Update requests appear to fall under the \"update_service/windows\" appID, and normal web requests fall under the \"http/get\" appID. XKEYSCORE can automatically detect Airblue travel itineraries with the \"travel/airblue\" fingerprint, and iPhone web browser traffic with the \"browser/cellphone/iphone\" fingerprint.\nPGP-encrypted messages are detected with the \"encryption/pgp/message\" fingerprint, and messages encrypted with Mojahedeen Secrets 2 (a type of encryption popular among supporters of al Qaeda) are detected with the \"encryption/mojaheden2\" fingerprint.\nWhen new traffic flows into an XKEYSCORE cluster, the system tests the intercepted data against each of these rules and stores whether the traffic matches the pattern. A slideshow presentation from 2010 says that XKEYSCORE contains almost 10,000 appIDs and fingerprints.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-app-for-that-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nAppIDs are used to identify the protocol of traffic being intercepted, while fingerprints detect a specific type of content. Each intercepted stream of traffic gets assigned up to one appID and any number of fingerprints. You can think of appIDs as categories and fingerprints as tags.\nIf multiple appIDs match a single stream of traffic, the appID with the lowest \"level\" is selected (appIDs with lower levels are more specific than appIDs with higher levels). For example, when XKEYSCORE is assessing a file attachment from Yahoo mail, all of the appIDs in the following slide will apply, however only \"mail/webmail/yahoo/attachment\" will be associated with this stream of traffic.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-appids-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nTo tie it all together, when an Arabic speaker logs into a Yahoo email address, XKEYSCORE will store \"mail/yahoo/login\" as the associated appID. This stream of traffic will match the \"mail/arabic\" fingerprint (denoting language settings), as well as the \"mail/yahoo/ymbm\" fingerprint (which detects Yahoo browser cookies).\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-appids-fingerprints-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nSometimes the GENESIS programming language, which largely relies on Boolean logic, regular expressions and a set of simple functions, isn't powerful enough to do the complex pattern-matching required to detect certain types of traffic. In these cases, as one slide puts it, \"Power users can drop in to C++ to express themselves.\" AppIDs or fingerprints that are written in C++ are called microplugins.\nHere's an example of a microplugin fingerprint for \"botnet/conficker_p2p_udp_data,\" which is tricky botnet traffic that can't be identified without complicated logic. A botnet is a collection of hacked computers, sometimes millions of them, that are controlled from a single point.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-conficker-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nHere's another microplugin that uses C++ to inspect intercepted Facebook chat messages and pull out details like the associated email address and body of the chat message.\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://goodtimesweb.org/surveillance/2015/xks-facebook-chat-540x405.png\" style=\"width: 540px; height: 405px;\"/>\nOne document from 2009 describes in detail four generations of appIDs and fingerprints, which begin with only the ability to scan intercepted traffic for keywords, and end with the ability to write complex microplugins that can be deployed to field sites around the world in hours.\nIf XKEYSCORE development has continued at a similar pace over the last six years, it's likely considerably more powerful today.\nEmail the authors: micah.lee@theintercept.com, glenn.greenwald@theintercept.com, morgan@firstlook.org\n<em>Documents published with this

Documents from Edward Snowden show that the intelligence agency is arming America for future digital wars -- a struggle for control of the Internet that is already well underway.<br/>\n<br/>By Jacob Appelbaum, Aaron Gibson, Claudio Guarnieri, Andy Muller-Maguhn, Laura Poitras, Marcel Rosenbach, Leif Ryge, Hilmar Schmundt and Michael Sontheimer\nNormally, internship applicants need to have polished resumes, with volunteer work on social projects considered a plus. But at Politerain, the job posting calls for candidates with significantly different skill sets. We are, the ad says, \"looking for interns who want to break things.\"\nPoliterain is not a project associated with a conventional company. It is run by a US government intelligence organization, the National Security Agency (NSA). More precisely, it's operated by the NSA's digital snipers with Tailored Access Operations [1] (TAO), the department responsible for breaking into computers.\nPotential interns are also told that research into third party computers might include plans to \"remotely degrade or destroy opponent computers, routers, servers and network enabled devices by attacking the hardware.\" Using a program called Passionatepolka, for example, they may be asked to \"remotely brick network cards.\" With programs like Berserkr they would implant \"persistent backdoors\" and \"parasitic drivers\". Using another piece of software called Barnfire, they would \"erase the BIOS on a brand of servers that act as a backbone to many rival governments.\"\nAn intern's tasks might also include remotely destroying the functionality of hard drives. Ultimately, the goal of the internship program was \"developing an attacker's mindset.\"\nThe internship listing is eight years old, but the attacker's mindset has since become a kind of doctrine for the NSA's data spies. And the intelligence service isn't just trying to achieve mass surveillance of Internet communication, either. The digital spies of the Five Eyes alliance -- comprised of the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand -- want more.\n<strong>The Birth of D Weapons </strong>\nAccording to top secret documents from the archive of NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden seen exclusively by SPIEGEL, they are planning for wars of the future in which the Internet will play a critical role, with the aim of being able to use the net to paralyze computer networks and, by doing so, potentially all the infrastructure they control, including power and water supplies, factories, airports or the flow of money.\nDuring the 20th century, scientists developed so-called ABC weapons -- atomic, biological and chemical. It took decades before their deployment could be regulated and, at least partly, outlawed. New digital weapons have now been developed for the war on the Internet. But there are almost no international conventions or supervisory authorities for these D weapons, and the only law that applies is the survival of the fittest.\nCanadian media theorist Marshall McLuhan foresaw these developments decades ago. In 1970, he wrote, \"World War III is a guerrilla information war with no division between military and civilian participation.\" That's precisely the reality that spies are preparing for today.\nThe US Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force have already established their own cyber forces, but it is the NSA, also officially a military agency, that is taking the lead. It's no coincidence that the director of the NSA also serves as the head of the US Cyber Command. The country's leading data spy, Admiral Michael Rogers, is also its chief cyber warrior and his close to 40,000 employees are responsible for both digital spying and destructive network attacks.\n<strong>Surveillance only 'Phase 0' </strong>\nFrom a military perspective, surveillance of the Internet is merely \"Phase 0\" in the US digital war strategy. Internal NSA documents indicate that it is the prerequisite for everything that follows. They show that the aim of the surveillance is to detect vulnerabilities in enemy systems. Once \"stealthy implants\" have been placed to infiltrate enemy systems, thus allowing \"permanent accesses,\" then Phase Three has been achieved -- a phase headed by the word \"dominate\" in the documents. This enables them to \"control/destroy critical systems &amp; networks at will through pre-positioned accesses (laid in Phase 0).\" Critical infrastructure is considered by the agency to be anything that is important in keeping a society running: energy, communications and transportation. The internal documents state that the ultimate goal is \"real time controlled escalation\".\nOne NSA presentation proclaims that \"the next major conflict will start in cyberspace.\" To that end, the US government is currently undertaking a massive effort to digitally arm itself for network warfare. For the 2013 secret intelligence budget, the NSA projected it would need around $1 billion in order to increase the strength of its computer network attack operations. The budget included an increase of some $32 million for \"unconventional solutions\" alone.\nIn recent years, malware has emerged that experts have attributed to the NSA and its Five Eyes alliance based on a number of indicators. They include programs like Stuxnet, used to attack the Iranian nuclear program. Or Regin, a powerful spyware trojan that created a furor in Germany after it infected the USB stick of a high-ranking staffer to Chancellor Angela Merkel. Agents also used Regin in attacks against the European Commission, the EU's executive, and Belgian telecoms company Belgacom in 2011.<br/>\n<br/>Given that spies can routinely break through just about any security software, virtually all Internet users are at risk of a data attack.\nThe new documents shed some new light on other revelations as well. Although an attack called Quantuminsert has been widely reported by SPIEGEL and others, documentation shows that in reality it has a low success rate and it has likely been replaced by more reliable attacks such as Quantumdirk, which injects malicious content into chat services provided by websites such as Facebook and Yahoo. And computers infected with Straitbizarre can be turned into disposable and non-attributable \"shooter\" nodes. These nodes can then receive messages from the NSA's Quantum network, which is used for \"command and control for very large scale active exploitation and attack.\" The secret agents were also able to breach mobile phones by exploiting a vulnerability in the Safari browser in order to obtain sensitive data and remotely implant malicious code.\nIn this guerilla war over data, little differentiation is made between soldiers and civilians, the Snowden documents show. Any Internet user could suffer damage to his or her data or computer. It also has the potential to create perils in the offline world as well. If, for example, a D weapon like Barnfire were to destroy or \"brick\" the control center of a hospital as a result of a programming error, people who don't even own a mobile phone could be affected.\nIntelligence agencies have adopted \"plausible deniability\" as their guiding principle for Internet operations. To ensure their ability to do so, they seek to make it impossible to trace the author of the attack.\nIt's a stunning approach with which the digital spies deliberately undermine the very foundations of the rule of law around the globe. This approach threatens to transform the Internet into a lawless zone in which superpowers and their secret services operate according to their own whims with very few ways to hold them accountable for their actions.\nAttribution is difficult and requires considerable forensic effort. But in the new documents there are at least a few pointers. Querty, for example, is a keylogger that was part of the Snowden archive. It's a piece of software designed to surreptitiously intercept all keyboard keys pressed by the victim and record them for later inspection. It is an ordinary, indeed rather dated, keylogger. Similar software can already be found in numerous applications, so it doesn't seem to pose any acute danger -- but the sourcecode contained in it does reveal some interesting details. They suggest that this keylogger might be part of the large arsenal of modules that that belong to the Warriorpride program, a kind of universal Esperanto software used by all the Five Eyes partner agencies that at times was even able to break into iPhones, among other capabilities. The documents published by SPIEGEL include sample code from the keylogger to foster further research and enable the creation of appropriate defenses.<br/>\n<br/><strong>'Just a Bunch of Hackers' </strong>\nThe men and women working for the Remote Operations Center (ROC), which uses the codename S321, at the agency's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, work on one of the NSA's most crucial teams, the unit responsible for covert operations. S321 employees are located on the third floor of one of the main buildings on the NSA's campus. In one report from the Snowden archive, an NSA man reminisces about how, when they got started, the ROC people were \"just a bunch of hackers.\" Initially, people worked \"in a more ad hoc manner,\" the report states. Nowadays, however, procedures are \"more systematic\". Even before NSA management massively expanded the ROC group during the summer of 2005, the department's motto was, \"Your data is our data, your equipment is our equipment.\"\nThe agents sit in front of their monitors, working in shifts around the clock. Just how close the NSA has already gotten to its aim of \"global network dominance\" is illustrated particularly well by the work of department S31177, codenamed Transgression.<br/>\n<br/>The department's task is to trace foreign cyber attacks, observe and analyze them and, in the best case scenario, to siphon off the insights of competing intelligence agencies. This form of \"Cyber Counter Intelligence\" counts among the most delicate forms of modern spying.\n<strong>Part 2: How the NSA Reads Over Shoulders of Other Spies</strong><br/>\n<br/>In addition to providing a view of the US's own ability to conduct digital attacks, Snowden's archive also reveals the capabilities of other countries. The Transgression team has access to years of preliminary field work and experience at its disposal, including databases in which malware and network attacks from other countries are cataloged.\nThe Snowden documents show that the NSA and its Five Eyes partners have put numerous network attacks waged by other countries to their own use in recent years. One 2009 document states that the department's remit is to \"discover, understand (and) evaluate\" foreign attacks. Another document reads: \"Steal their tools, tradecraft, targets and take.\"\nIn 2009, an NSA unit took notice of a data breach affecting workers at the US Department of Defense. The department traced an IP address in Asia that functioned as the command center for the attack. By the end of their detective work, the Americans succeeded not only in tracing the attack's point of origin to China, but also in tapping intelligence information from other Chinese attacks -- including data that had been stolen from the United Nations. Afterwards, NSA workers in Fort Meade continued to read over their shoulders as the Chinese secretly collected further internal UN data. \"NSA is able to tap into Chinese SIGINT collection,\" a report on the success in 2011 stated. SIGINT is short for signals intelligence.<br/>\n<br/>The practice of letting other intelligence services do the dirty work and then tapping their results is so successful that the NSA even has a name for it: \"Fourth Party Collection.\" And all countries that aren't part of the Five Eye alliance are considered potential targets for use of this \"non-traditional\" technique -- even Germany.\n<strong>'Difficult To Track, Difficult To Target' </strong>\nThe Snowden documents show that, thanks to fourth party collection, the NSA succeeded in detecting numerous incidents of data spying over the past 10 years, with many attacks originating from China and Russia. It also enabled the Tailored Access Operations (TAO) to track down the IP address of the control server used by China and, from there, to detect the people responsible inside the Peoples' Liberation Army. It wasn't easy, the NSA spies noted. The Chinese had apparently used changing IP addresses, making them \"difficult to track; difficult to target.\" In the end, though, the document states, they succeeded in exploiting a central router.\nThe document suggests that things got more challenging when the NSA sought to turn the tables and go after the attacker. Only after extensive \"wading through uninteresting data\" did they finally succeed in infiltrating the computer of a high-ranking Chinese military official and accessing information regarding targets in the US government and in other governments around the world. They also were able to access sourcecode for Chinese malware.\nBut there have also been successful Chinese operations. The Snowden documents include an internal NSA assessment from a few years ago of the damage caused. The report indicates that the US Defense Department alone registered more than 30,000 known incidents; more than 1,600 computers connected to its network had been hacked. Surprisingly high costs are listed for damage assessment and network repair: more than $100 million.<br/>\n<br/>Among the data on \"sensitive military technologies\" hit in the attack were air refueling schedules, the military logistics planning system, missile navigation systems belonging to the Navy, information about nuclear submarines, missile defense and other top secret defense projects.\nThe desire to know everything isn't, of course, an affliction only suffered by the Chinese, Americans, Russians and British. Years ago, US agents discovered a hacking operation originating in Iran in a monitoring operation that was codenamed Voyeur. A different wave of attacks, known as Snowglobe, appears to have originated in France.\n<strong>Transforming Defenses into Attacks </strong>\nThe search for foreign cyber attacks has long since been largely automated by the NSA and its Five Eyes partners. The Tutelage system can identify incursions and ensure that they do not reach their targets.\nThe examples given in the Snowden documents are not limited to attacks originating in China. The relatively primitive Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) is also mentioned. The name refers to malware used by the protest movement Anonymous to disable target websites. In that instance, one document notes, Tutelage was able to recognize and block the IP addresses being used to conduct the denial of service attack.\nThe NSA is also able to transform its defenses into an attack of its own. The method is described as \"reverse engineer, repurpose software\" and involves botnets, sometimes comprising millions of computers belonging to normal users onto which software has been covertly installed. They can thus be controlled remotely as part of a \"zombie army\" to paralyze companies or to extort them. If the infected hosts appear to be within the United States, the relevant information will be forwarded to the FBI Office of Victim Assistance. However, a host infected with an exploitable bot could be hijacked through a Quantumbot attack and redirected to the NSA. This program is identified in NSA documents as Defiantwarrior and it is said to provide advantages such as \"pervasive network analysis vantage points\" and \"throw-away non-attributable CNA (eds: computer network attack) nodes\". This system leaves people's computers vulnerable and covertly uses them for network operations that might be traced back to an innocent victim. Instead of providing protection to private Internet users, Quantumbot uses them as human shields in order to disguise its own attacks.\nNSA specialists at the Remote Operations Center (ROC) have an entire palette of digital skeleton keys and crowbars enabling access to even the best protected computer networks. They give their tools aggressive-sounding names, as though they were operating an app-store for cyber criminals: The implant tool \"Hammerchant\" allows the recording of Internet-based phone calls (VoIP). Foxacid allows agents to continually add functions to small malware programs even after they have been installed in target computers. The project's logo is a fox that screams as it is dissolved in acid. The NSA has declined to comment on operational details but insists that it has not violated the law.<br/>\n<br/>But as well developed as the weapons of digital war may be, there is a paradox lurking when it comes to breaking into and spying on third party networks: How can intelligence services be sure that they won't become victims of their own methods and be infiltrated by private hackers, criminals or other intelligence services, for example?\nTo control their malware, the Remote Operation Center operatives remain connected to them via their own shadow network, through which highly sensitive telephone recordings, malware programs and passwords travel.\nThe incentive to break into this network is enormous. Any collection of VPN keys, passwords and backdoors is obviously of very high value. Those who possess such passwords and keys could theoretically pillage bank accounts, thwart military deployments, clone fighter jets and shut down power plants. It means nothing less than \"global network dominance\".\nBut the intelligence world is a schizophrenic one. The NSA's job is to defend the Internet while at the same time exploiting its security holes. It is both cop and robber, consistent with the motto adhered to by spies everywhere: \"Reveal their secrets, protect our own.\"\nAs a result, some hacked servers are like a bus during rush hour, with people constantly coming and going. The difference, though, is that the server's owner has no idea anyone is there. And the presumed authorities stand aside and do nothing.\n<strong>'Unwitting Data Mules' </strong>\nIt's absurd: As they are busy spying, the spies are spied on by other spies. In response, they routinely seek to cover their tracks or to lay fake ones instead. In technical terms, the ROC lays false tracks as follows: After third-party computers are infiltrated, the process of exfiltration can begin -- the act of exporting the data that has been gleaned. But the loot isn't delivered directly to ROC's IP address. Rather, it is routed to a so-called Scapegoat Target. That means that stolen information could end up on someone else's servers, making it look as though they were the perpetrators.\nBefore the data ends up at the Scapegoat Target, of course, the NSA intercepts and copies it using its mass surveillance infrastructure and sends it on to the ROC. But such cover-up tactics increase the risk of a controlled or uncontrolled escalation between the agencies involved.\nIt's not just computers, of course, that can be systematically broken into, spied on or misused as part of a botnet. Mobile phones can also be used to steal information from the owner's employer. The unwitting victim, whose phone has been infected with a spy program, smuggles the information out of the office. The information is then retrieved remotely as the victim heads home after work. Digital spies have even adopted drug-dealer slang in referring to these unsuspecting accomplices. They are called \"unwitting data mules.\"\nNSA agents aren't concerned about being caught. That's partly because they work for such a powerful agency, but also because they don't leave behind any evidence that would hold up in court. And if there is no evidence of wrongdoing, there can be no legal penalty, no parliamentary control of intelligence agencies and no international agreement. Thus far, very little is known about the risks and side-effects inherent in these new D weapons and there is almost no government regulation.<br/>\n<br/>Edward Snowden has revealed how intelligence agencies around the world, led by the NSA, are doing their best to ensure a legal vacuum in the Internet. In a recent interview with the US public broadcaster PBS, the whistleblower voiced his concerns that \"defense is becoming less of a priority than offense.\"<br/>\nSnowden finds that concerning. \"What we need to do,\" he said, \"is we need to create new international standards of behavior.\"\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://goodtimesweb.org/overseas-war/2015/image-800193-galleryV9-pzti.jpg\" style=\"width: 850px; height: 637px;\"/><br/>\n<br/>The National Security Agency intelligence service isn't just trying to achieve mass surveillance of Internet communication.
